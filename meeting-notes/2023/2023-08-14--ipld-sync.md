## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Gave a talk about ["Collaborative mapping without internet connectivity"](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2023/talk/review/ZUJZKKU7HR7QXGGTRJHLXMMTPZHQAYKC) at the [FOSS4G 2023 conference](https://2023.foss4g.org/)
    - Source code is at: https://github.com/vmx/colleemap


@rvagg
 - https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/releases/tag/v0.21.0 go-ipld-prime release
     - Traversal "preloader" for parallelism in laoding blocks during traversal
     - Selectors: "match" selector now has more features in range selection - to support byte ranges in large blocks, including negative indexes similar to range specifiers in HTTP
 - Lots of retrieval work in [Lassie](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lassie) and [Frisbii](https://github.com/ipld/frisbii) particularly on byte ranges of large files using selectors
 - Mentions:
     - Proposal from @gozala in js-multiformats for a streaming multihash: https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/issues/260
     - Ongoing discussion about TypeScript in js-multiformats: https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/issues/249

@bumblefudge
 - Working on gettting Multibase and Multihash specs into IETF
 - no ask/action items for now!
 - `reserved` properties -
     - multibase-eligible range should probably be all printable ASCII minus a few obvious exceptions (`?` and `#`?)
     - NUL corresponds to a unicode code point, but it isn't one exactly (it's a byte)
     - we are not removing 0x00, but make it reserved
 - `base2` - Rod: educational/experimental, but not implemented by anyone
     - `0` --> `1` and `candidate` --> `experimental`
 - more generally, aligning all the registries with IANA status terms would be great
