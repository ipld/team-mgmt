## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - `libipld` (Rust IPLD) v0.16 was released which contains a spec compliant DAG-PB implemenation. Thanks for @dignifiedquire for doing this work.

@rvagg
 - New releases of go-car, now including binary downloads in the Releases page, `car` commandline is actually pretty useful (`ls`, `debug`, etc.)
 - Updated go-multicodec with latest multicodec table (auto-updates were broken)
 - Proposed JSON form of multicodec table: https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/311
 - go-car CARv1 writable blockstore interface that writes to a streaming `io.Writer`: https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/360
 - js-car now has a `CarBufferReader` to do fully sync reads, thanks to @hugomrdias et. al.
 - Archived go-ipldtool for now, not enough bandwidth to maintain
 - Discussing what a validated-blockstore interface / utility might look like for JS: https://github.com/ipld/js-car/issues/123

@nathaniel_c_cook
 - Rust implementation of DAG-JOSE codec.
 - https://github.com/ipld/libipld/pull/177
