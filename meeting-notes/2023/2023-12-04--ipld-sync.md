  - _add your agenda item_


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - New rust-cid 0.11 release: now based on rust-multihash 0.19

@rvagg
 - go-ipld-prime: Some invalid JSON can be parsed, release is coming
     -  https://github.com/polydawn/refmt/pull/58
 -  https://github.com/ipld/codec-fixtures all valid fixture blocks are now on web3.storage for use through the gateway (where they can be read by the stack), also a fixtures.car in there too now

@aschmahmann
- Was at DCxPrague recently and talking to people about how using the eth_getproof call (https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getproof) to fetch the data to execute the RPC locally looks an awful lot like how we use CAR exports with the IPFS Trustless Gateway API.
  - There might be a bunch of overlap here to explore since this is operating in a very IPLD-like way (e.g. resolve mutable point, then do execution/processing on the immutable DAG). This is true even if there aren't some existing standards around say pathing through DAGs that have multiblock data structures that aren't just UnixFS 
  - Interesting in the context of reducing the trust needed to interact with a DApp (e.g. you can use a light client like https://github.com/a16z/helios).
  - Came up in the context of IPFS + DApps WG https://lu.ma/ipfs-dapps
- In lieu of this call there might be some in the IPFS community calendar that are interesting/useful to people https://lu.ma/ipfs (e.g. office hours, IPFS implementers WG, etc.)

## Notes

@alanshaw: o-ipld-prime question:
 - web3storage is doing UCAN stuff
 - wants Go client that does similar UCAN things as the JS stuff
 - is there a way to generate Go structs from the Schema?
     - untyped node interface 
     - 2 ways for typed way:
       - typed node interface: really verbose
       - bindnode: infere Schema from Go type
         - generating Go types from Schema is missing
         - you can use "converters" that plug into bindnode. Examples can be found in the [Filecoin State Types](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-retrieval-types).
 - UCAN RPC: What if you have a partial Schema
   - Define your Schema and where it's partial use "Any" and in your Go code you get the full data (a Data Model node) of what is there.
   - The voucher schema @rvagg is talking about: https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-data-transfer/blob/master/message/message1_1prime/schema.ipldsch

@vmx: Thanks everyone who attended this meeting over the past few years!
