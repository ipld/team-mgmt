## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

### Determining next steps for CIDv2: https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/305

 - https://github.com/multiformats/cid/pull/49
 - @vmx spoke to John who opened the original PR and doesn't want to push it further now.
 - We can close it as @vmx has a new proposal: https://hackmd.io/@vmx/SygxnMmso

### Next steps for jwk-jcs https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/307

 - JWK schema over JSON Canonical
 - Its tag is `key`, they apparently want to use it in the did:key field to signal a jwk format, this is _not_ for a CID, so concerns about IPLD codecs don't apply here
 - Resolved that as long as this is a `key` then it's up to the user what they're doing with this and we shouldn't hold it up
