## Weekly Update

@rvagg 

 - go-car v2.7.0 now includes a new `storage` interface to match the go-ipld-prime storage reader/writer interfaces to be used directly on a LinkSystem. Doesn't use any of the old Block-based APIs.
     - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/storage
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/36
     - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-car/v2@v2.7.0/storage
 - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/pull/171 by @achingbrain to get unixfs in JS to match the test fixtures for Kubo and go-unixfsnode for auto-sharding UnixFS directories; a big deal for cross-language compat in UnixFS.
 - Example for someone in #ipld using go-car and go-codec-dagpb and go-ipld-prime to make a CAR with custom dag-pb blocks: https://go.dev/play/p/o9Kf1fjyN_g

@nathaniel_c_cook
 - DAG-JOSE Rust implementation now lives at: https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-dag-jose
 - Proposal for bytes type: https://github.com/ipld/libipld/issues/178
   - @vmx mentions that https://docs.rs/serde_bytes/ might do that already
