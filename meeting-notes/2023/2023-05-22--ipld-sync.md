## Weekly Update


@rvagg
 - New UnixFS test data generation utilities for Go: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode@v1.7.0/testutil
 - `listpairs` support in schema parser and bindnode in go-ipld-prime
 - JS @ipld/dag-json support for ingesting typedarrays (they all are squashed to uint8arrays)
 - Archived non-maintained repositories @ github.com/multiformats - lots of alt language implementations that don't have active maintainers - the encouragement is to fork or create new ones then add links back from ipld.io to your implementation.
 - New Python page @ https://ipld.io/libraries/python/
 - Lots of work on DAG retrieval, https://github.com/filecoin-project/lassie now has support for the new trustless, verified CAR HTTP retrieval protocol (on top of Graphsync and Bitswap); lots and lots of IPLD under the hood (traversals, selectors, CARs)


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

@RangerMauve: Presenting some IPLD visualizations with GraphViz
 - [car2dot](https://github.com/RangerMauve/car2dot) is a CLI tool to convert a CAR file into dot file, which then can be visualized via GraphViz
 - Also shows code on how to plug IPLD things (Multiformats, codecs) together
 - Shows that you can use IPLD even outside of IPFS

If you want to learn about identity CIDs and some of their problems, keep watching.

Talking about using JavaScript UnixFS for chunking things manually. See https://github.com/webrecorder/specs/blob/main/wacz-ipfs/latest/index.md for more information.
