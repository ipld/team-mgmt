@ribasushi
 - Wrapping up a small utility interfacing with stream-dagger, to quickly pull files-as-streams off a filesystem
 - Preliminary discovery what could we safely add to the DHT given the current network state

@rvagg
 - working on btc docs for specs
 - started on zcash, going very smoothly so far given the btc work
 - started working on Go impl of Tim's shorthand selector syntax

@mikeal
 - mostly manager stuff and being out due to back pain
 - minimal js-multiformats work
 - this week will be finishing up js-multiformats


## Notes

 - @gozala is working on improving `js-ipld-dag-pb` to make it work with the pure IPLD Data Model: https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb/pull/184
 - Volker out Thu 2020-06-11
 - @ribasuhsi: How to deal with the IPFS DHT and IPLDified Bitcoin blockchain?
   - You cannot put the full blockchain into the DHT => not everything can be addressed by CID
   - @rvagg: My work haven't had the goal to put everything into IPFS. Subset in IPFS would be cool though
   - It's an IPFS concern, not an IPLD one :)
   - Suddenly (some time after 0:30) we talk about reverse indexes, lists of links that link to a certain block
