## Weekly Update

@mikeal

- none of my picked battles this week are code, not a lot to report
- future: would love to borrow somebody to run by some thoughts and try to draft some ideas about "power pathing" (? working title)

@rvagg
 - Verifying BTC sequentially now I have the blockchain in IPLD form; found another problem with SegWit that might get block "time" involved
 - BTC docs, started a (big) spec/ doc
 - Cleaned up BTC code, ready to push most pieces pening some multiformats work that needs to be resolved
