## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD/IPFS is taking up pace
   - Major Rust Multihash API change is coming: https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash/pull/45
   - Getting a list of interested parties in Rust IPFS: https://github.com/ipfs-rust/welcome/issues/1
   - Call with [Rust IPFS dev grant](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/pull/13) people: https://hackmd.io/5qWD0iu4ScGhqdU5_oYI_Q?view
 - Next:
   - Rust IPLD Block API draft
   - Writing a blog post about Rust IPFS efforts

@creationix
 - Selector Syntax
    - Adressed feedback in Github PR
    - Still implementing parser to flesh out spec.
    - Almost done with lexer.  The weird identifier rules mentioned before are somewhat tricky.

@rvagg
 - CommP:
     - Rust Lambda https://github.com/rvagg/rust-fil-commp-generate/
         - Too much memory for Lambda capacity @ 1G pieces
         - Wrote a merkle tree caching store that splits up the 3G mem + 500M disk to squeeze it in
         - Seems to be working, @vmx helped review code, one concerning bug that didn't seem to impact correct calculation (but why???)
     - Chipping away at a JS version of CommP components because I want to be more confident I know what it's doing
 - Productive chat with Eric about IPLD internal representations vs API surface, sorting, vertical integration of components while maintaining solid APIs - ipld-prime, next-gen JS, implications for Rust (need to share notes with @vmx).

@mikeal
 - big data project
     - re-wrote slicer to 912mb
     - re-running lots of processing and car part creation
     - ~~a little blocked on commP~~
 - DagDB - idea phase, interested in feedback

@warpfork

- split, organized, and increased readiness of new 'basicnode' (formerly 'ipldfree') packages.
	- did *not* make my goal to new interfaces into core and get codecs, traversals, etc all ported this week :(  that was too ambitious by half, unfortunately.
	- mostly done splitting 'basicnode' from the 'demogen' content -- turned out nontrivial, learned a key lesson for codegen later
		- (i had some codegen-like prototypes in the research packages intermingled *with* the new 'basicnode' stuff... and disentangling them revealed at least one issue with the proto-codegen demos: they really *need* their own go types for primitive scalar kinds.  Not the end of the world: but also not obvious, so I wanted to make sure A) this is true and B) write a decent doc about it.  Turns out maintaining the immutability contracts indirectly requires this.)
    - good sideffect: got more docs of the design decisions
- opened several new design discussion issues and a couple small feature help-wanted's:
	- list:
		- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/45 -- 'fasttraversal'?
		- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/44 -- 'traversal.Jump'
		- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/42 -- 'cursor' traversals?
		- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/43 -- request for opinions on error returns
	- if anyone out there wants to sling a little go code on a nice self-contained issue, #44 and #42 are pretty fun
- some conversations have started on go-ipfs integrating more of go-ipld-prime; might assist on some research on scoping and planning that


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

Question @vmx: Could the part in commp which currently needs 2x the size be made streaming? Would it be easy?
 - @rvagg: It seeks, but only 1-2 bytes: see https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/e6055a1ef59c70b6db9fc579cb6435dff8f96dc1/filecoin-proofs/src/fr32.rs#L709 

Question @rvagg: why 912MB for the data slices?
  - @mikeal: Enough space for root block and other overhead (which is hard to estimate)
