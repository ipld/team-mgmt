## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - [tiny-multihash](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/tiny-multihash) should be ready to get merged upstream
   - I still need need figure out if I just make a merge commit or if I pick pieces of it
 - Rust IPLD related changes lead to a discussion on what a "multicodec" actually is. Is it just the code, or could it also be what I call "Ipld Codec": https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/288

@ribasushi
 - Still a :man_in_lotus_position: ( I miss you guys :crying_cat_face: )

@mvdan
 - Getting up to speed on IPLD docs and specs. Started capturing my perspective in an "exploration report".
 - Filed [an issue](https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/289) for the dag-json spec, since strings can be encoded in many ways via unicode escapes.

@warpfork
- looking at some memory profiling in filecoin and how some parts of it relate to our libraries
- some PRs to reduce allocations in codecs have been landed: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/70
- doing some task enumerating -- writing down a bunch of the things that live in my head :)
- @mvdan has landed a halfdozen fixes to go-ipld-prime and is renovating a bunch of the CI, which is highly welcome
- had meeting with the textile+3box folks and the new developer looking at JOSE implementations for go; walked around codebase with them.
	- a lot of the implementation choices will live in hands of that developer, and commitments weren't made in that meeting, but they're now equipped with lots of information
	- discussed a variety of different ways we could reuse as much codec code as possible (reuse token pump packages?  or write assembler delegates?  or etc); or aim in ADL direction entirely
	- likely outcome: aim in ADL direction in implementing (e.g. functions with sigature `func(Node)->Node`); tether it togeter into codec at the last minute; best of both worlds.

@mikeal
 - [ZDAG](https://github.com/mikeal/zdag)
   - Much better at explaining it now
   - Detailed spec, found several more compression techniques
   - Found a few **huge** compression wins

@rvagg
 - misc
 - big batch of changes for CAR JS library, mainly ESM, new multiformats, Uint8Arrays, other bits and pieces of "modernisation" https://github.com/ipld/js-datastore-car/pull/7
 - moving the API to a better block storage API https://github.com/ipld/js-datastore-car/issues/9 (current API relates to older IPFS datastore needs which are not very relevant and don't match our CID:Binary pairing abstraction - js-block)

## Notes

 - Long discussion about mutablility and immutability. Watch it!
