## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Importing the OSM planet is a nice use case for a custom IPFS chunker
 - Next:
     - Open an issue on the [OGC API Features Core spec](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) at https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features to allow non-HTTP protocols

@rvagg
 - OOO for last week, nothing meaningful to report

@warpfork
 - some more finishing touches on https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/49
     - does anyone have opinions on API feel here?: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/49#issuecomment-597549108
     - @rvagg: `basicnode.Style.Map` _will_ read nicer to non-Go programmers than `Style__Map`, certainly looks less codegen (and therefore less scary to touch -- "ohh, this looks like internal plumbing, should I be touching it?")
 - doing some research on ipfs<3ipld and charting migrations from previous generation go ipld interfaces to the new stuff

@mikeal
 - refactor on large data work
     - interesting new approach to S3 block store
 - lots of dagdb progress
     - new .car use cases
     - need more sorted index data structures :)
 - COVID-19 contingency planning

@chafey
 - met with @mikeal to discuss how I could help - going to provide feedback from an app developer point of view
 - available to help on other things if others want/need
 - have first step of my medical imaging prototype working
     - Need some kind of ipld/ipfs based db, looked into orbitdb but has limited data in can hold - interested in dagdb :)


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

Q: Does GraphSync replace Bitswap?
  - No, they both have their use cases. Bitswap is good for many peers, GraphSync is good with direct connections.

Watch the end of the video for an introduction/overview of Advanced Data Layouts from @warpfork.
