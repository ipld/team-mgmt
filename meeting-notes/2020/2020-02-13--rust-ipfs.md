## Notes

Decision: Not to record call, just take good meeting minutes

- Introductions
    - **Mark** - programming , project. Wants to get a good working relationship out of the call. How can we  work best together
    - **Joonas** - latest hire at Equilibrium, strong history in enterprise software. Wants to learn PL internal Rust roadmap/work
    - **Volker Mische** - Protocol Labs IPLD team. (JS and Rust) Recently working with Rust-IPLD. 
    - **Hugo Dias** - Protocol Labs (core developer, JS implementation) interest in Rust, improving skills.
    - PL wants to know 
        - what we are doing and who does which things?

- Grant Review
  - Hugo:
      - Make sure we focus on the things that are useful for the Ecosystem: WASM, IoT, Browser. *Not* e.g. Gateway
        - Gateway is Phase2
        - IoT on constraint devices should just work, due to the nature of Rust
            - Bare metal is out of scope
        - WASM: Won't work out of the box, it won't be a drop-in replacement for the JS implementation (agreement!) (super important to PL)
            - But make sure we make it possible that some modules can be used
            - Moving from node-first to browser-first
            - Hugo is interested especially in crypto, though that might not be that easy as large data inputs+outputs have perf issues and also Rust crypto stuff is often using SIMD instructions/ASM which doesn cannot easily be compiled to WASM
            - libp2p is working towards WASM, but may not be as useful as we'd like
  - Make it work "somehow". Making nice APIs/interfaces later
  - Look out for Bitswap (new spec) - one time call with Dirk
  - Blockstore
      - Look at batch writing to disk in safe way (or not?)
      - PL is _open to ideas_ here from fresh faces in a fresh language
    
- Comms
    - Most communication can/should happen on GitHub
    - Calls as needed
    - MH + maybe JK should attend IPFS call on Mondays
        - Document with main goals updated as we go's

- Questions
    - **What about mobile?**
        - Same as IoT device
    - **What makes a good WASM module?**
        - Unix Philosophy - does one thing and one thing good
        - Node-specific
        - Small inputs / Small outputs
        - processing heavy - not data bound
        - Shared buffer
    - **Status of IPLD API?**
        - Current IPLD Block API in JS implementatio is "solid": https://github.com/ipld/js-block
        - Draft of block API in repo (Volker will link)

**Rust Intefaces and Abstraction**

- Known "does not work" solutions from go, js
    - Not written down at the moment

- Action items
  - Get a list of _people_ involved in Rust related things
  - Get a list of candidates for WASM module replacement in js-ipfs
  - PL Questions
      - Funding
      - Schedule
      - Tech point of contact (Volker for now)
      - Management Point of contact
  - IPLD API might become a blocker / priority based on multiformats work
  - Volker to link draft IPLD API
    - Heavily based on https://github.com/ipld/js-block
