## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust Multihash: Working on getting prior functionality back (https://github.com/ipfs-rust/tiny-multihash/issues/12), lead to massive simplifcation. Less traits, less code, less duplication. Should be done the next few days.
 - Next:
   - Integrate that new rust-multihash into rust-cid and libp2p

@mvdan 
 - Continued with go-ipld-adl-hamt
     - had a helpful call with Rod/Peter to discuss HAMT specifics
 - Wrote the first half of the "intro to IPLD" in Go
 - Dug myself into a rabbit hole for go-multicodec
     - looks like I'll be code generating a light Go package with consts
 - Started writing down future wanted changes to go-ipld-prime's APIs with Eric
     - to be considered once Filecoin calms down a bit

@mikeal
  - lots of docs work
  - new spec site is up and well linked to
  - ipmd experiment
  - took on pathing spec


@warpfork
 - Introducing some more helper functions for constructing data: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/81
 - Prototype of a potential new way to handle LinkLoader and such: https://gist.github.com/warpfork/c0200cc4d99ee36ba5ce5a612f1d1a22
 	- Is the potential big address to the long-standing questions in https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/55 .
 	- Resulted in a bunch of smaller function type declarations that have only one or two parameters and results each...
 		- ... and then a single built-in gadget composes them (and offers all the user-friendly helper methods in one place).
 		- Generally feels a lot simpler.

@rvagg
 - DAG-PB! Should be finished now (?)
     - https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-pb/ ready for publish
     - https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/58 mirrored in https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-pb/blob/master/test/test-forms.js to test (and confirm) the edges of the format
     - https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/297 winds up the spec changes - mostly just adding detail about things not describable in schema

@yourname
 - _add what you've been working on_


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

- dag-pb:
	- encoded data that doesn't have a hash??
		- yeah, what's the incidence rate of in existing encoded data?
		- what do existing libraries do with this?!
		- it would be nice if we could not tolerate that.
