## Agenda

- General
  - Start recording
  - Start live stream
  - Find a notetaker
  - Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
  - Ask everyone to put their items that they've been working on the past two weeks (should be done prior to the meeting)
  - Ask for last minute agenda items
- This meeting
  - @chafey Idea of having multiple CIDs per block - one for semantic value and others for actual representation (encryption, compression, etc) 


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD: Reviewing major refactoring using the stack allocated stuff: https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipld/pull/47
 - Next:
   - Get tiny-multihash changes upstreamed

@ribasushi
 - No IPLD updates
 - GOING TO RACE IN SPACE at the end of this meeting

@chafey
 - Back from my extended vacation / personal leave
 - Started working on js-graphsync: https://github.com/chafey/js-graphsync
     - Could use some help to get answers to a few questions about go-graphsync from anyone that can help since Hannah is really busy 

@warpfork
- Recently worked on a new brief "primer" document for an all-in-one intro to IPLD, currently here: https://hackmd.io/LHTTmGSWSvem4Wz2h_a39g?both
	- May work this into our more formal documentation, or... not; undecided.
	- Want to _keep it terse_ -- not be a document for everyone.  It's already too long.
- New test and fixture system for schema behaviors, hitting the go codegen: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/66
	- Uses json for fixture shorthand; probes the node from many directions, consistently, given just the fixture.  Better coverage with fewer lines per testcase than before.
	- Only used for a handful of tests around structs so far, but will expand this in the future.
- go-ipld-prime's traversal package finally has a `traversal.Get` function -- does what it says on the tin, tersely.  (Doesn't require a callback.)
	- Added in https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/65

@rvagg 
- Tidied up Go HAMT & AMT work for Filecoin
    - https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-hamt-ipld/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arvagg
    - https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-amt-ipld/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arvagg
    - They won't be accepting the breaking block format changes unfortunately, a bit too close to launch, though they're in the pipeline for next major network upgrade post launch (maybe)
- JavaScript ESM battles

@mikeal
 - ESM stuff: all modules now use the same tooling
 - zdag 
     - idea for new block format
     - block format as a compression table
     - shaves ~10% off of dag-cbor


## Notes

### Multiple CIDs per block

- @chafey shared suggestion relating to encryption / compression
- Per-block: one CID for semantic value - for sync and referencing, and others for _actual_ representation as stored (encryption, compression, etc)
- @rvagg: it would essentially be making an intermediate wrapper block, possibly with a new codec, but what does it buy you?
- it's not so much "breaking content addressability"... it's breaking (uncoordinated) convergence: this produces rather exponential garbage variations when there's a tree structure.
- general question of if a one-size-fits-all pattern is actually extractable here.
- observation: compression on filecoin data bought 3% size, but doubling the time cost of serialization.  very questionable if this is "always" worth it.

### Mikeal's proposed block format

- Mikeal showed us a presentation about his new block format that he's been working on
- @vmx mentions https://github.com/couchbaselabs/fleece as similar format

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
