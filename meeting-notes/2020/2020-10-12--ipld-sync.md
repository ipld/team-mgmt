  - _add your agenda item_


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - WASM: Idea: Read-only codecs that can by WASM runtimes
   - Looked into current state of [Interface Types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types). Not implemented, I don't expect it to happen soon
   - In the meantime to get data from host to WASM runtime, serialize it to just some binary format (e.g. CBOR)
   - [simple-dag](https://github.com/mikeal/simple-dag): just use CBOR instead
 - Next:
   - Get rust-multihash releases (PR rust-cid, libp2p and libipld)

@mvdan 
 - first working version of go-ipld-adl-prime
   - lots of TODOs, e.g. only supports bytes as values
   - will continue with the TODOs, pretty much
   - discussed APIs in ipld-prime to better support deleting entries with Eric
 - call tomorrow to finish up changes to the HAMT spec
 - want to get started incorporating HAMT compliance test fixtures the sooner the better

@mikeal
 - [multiformats/block](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/blob/master/src/block.js) landed
 - [mikeal/dkv](https://github.com/mikeal/dkv) created to dogfood new block interface
 - @ipld/block ??? still figuring out exactly what we need in here now

@warpfork 
 - We had a new gathering in the last week to start pushing through further docs and specs needs more synchonously.
 - Will be working on additional documentation needs enumeration in the coming weeks.
 - Working on a full round up of all string specification discussions to date and proposed resolution.

@rvagg 
 - Light duties last week - public holiday + end of school holidays for the kids
 - go-dagpb work
 - some weekend hacking on new JS cbor handling library, almost at usable state, keep on uncovering other dag-cbor concerns in the process
 - discussion with IPFS and Go folks about maintenance of overlapping libraries that are currently in maintenance-limbo (no real author). go-cid in particular has been neglected recently and we care about it. Adin identified some repos that are "obviously IPLD": go-ipld-cbor, go-ipld-format, go-merkledag, go-cid. I suggested we (I, maybe @mvdan) could take some basic maintenance responsibility for these, at least handling incoming issues & PRs so they don't look like abandonware. At some point along the ipld-prime maturity curve we should mark some of them as "Maintenance Mode".
 - Some insight to my current yak shaving stack:

```
Target: Nice, shared test fixtures mechanism for IPLD libraries
 -> CAR files (not strictly essential but very helpful)
    * JS library is out of sync with the modern JS stack, and the "datastore"
      API sucks and needed reinventing - I'm in the process of that with @Gozala
    * Test fixtures in the CAR library have a dependency on DAG-PB libraries
      that are _way_ out of sync and get in the way
    -> DAG-PB library for new stack was being studiously avoided by all of us, I
       took that on
       * Found DAG-PB to be a deep rabbit hole
       * Implemented manual, and _strict_, DAG-PB encoder/decoder for JS,
         adapted for new stack - `@ipld/dag-pb`
       * Implemented manual, and _strict_, DAG-PB low-level encoder/decoder for
         Go since I could easily port what I had in JS (and in my brain).
       * Trying my hand at a go-ipld-prime codec to wrap around the DAG-PB
         encoder/decoder (rvagg/go-dagpb). Learning more go-ipld-prime in the
         process.
  -> Need to use DAG-JSON as a component of test fixtures (perhaps just for
     authoriting and simple variants) but found outstanding issues:
       * Go doesn't properly support Bytes - we need solid and matching Go & JS
         implemenations.
       * Outstanding question about Bytes being base64 or multibase base64
       * Outstanding quesiton about tokenization options for Go - can we reject
         forms of `{"/"{"bytes":"..."}}` during decode that are _not quite_ or
         do we have to fall back to standard map representation.
```

@ribasushi
 - I HAVE IPLD-ISH THINGS THIS WEEK OMG !!!!!11111oneoneone
     - Got lotus to run against an SQL database as a blockstore ( *not* a datastore, distinction is sadly super-important )
         - https://github.com/ribasushi/ltsh/compare/40b2e2d...f30875b
     - Troubles from above:
        - Can not use CIDs https://github.com/ribasushi/ltsh/compare/40b2e2d...f30875b#diff-598487f3eb733492e77514e34d5338f2R26-R33
        - There is a "list everything" interface everything has to implement: https://github.com/ribasushi/ltsh/compare/40b2e2d...f30875b#diff-598487f3eb733492e77514e34d5338f2R101
            - `func (cbs *chainBS) AllKeysChan(ctx context.Context) (<-chan cid.Cid, error) {... }`
        - There are spots where the codec outright doesn't matter on GET: https://github.com/ribasushi/ltsh/compare/40b2e2d...f30875b#diff-598487f3eb733492e77514e34d5338f2R135-R137
     - Allows us to get to blocks-in-IPFS and blocks-in-S3 future, also unblocks a little of sentinel work



## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
