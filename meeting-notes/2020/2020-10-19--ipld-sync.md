  - Ask for last minute agenda items
- This meeting
  - @rvagg: Discuss issue [#1248 DealProposal's Label field serializes as non-UTF8](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/issues/1248)
  - @chafey: is there an ADL for BTREE?


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - docs: generated exploration reports out of PRs with as script (https://github.com/vmx/export_issues):
   - [Selector Syntax](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/4040875bf6234f5b26808b97a49517e7aedb2928/design/history/exploration-reports/2020.02-selector-syntax.md)
   - [New DAG-JSON](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/4040875bf6234f5b26808b97a49517e7aedb2928/design/history/exploration-reports/2019.06-new-version-dag-json.md)
 - Rust: I had hoped https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1792 will be reviewed quickly. I will push changes I want to make to rust-multihash anyway and if there isn't much action soon, I'll release rust-multihash nonetheless.
   - This also blocks a new rust-cid release
 - Proof of concept to show that [simple-dag](https://github.com/mikeal/simple-dag) is very similar to a minimal DAG-CBOR implementation: https://github.com/mikeal/simple-dag/pull/8
 - IPLD and strings: I want IPLD Data Model strings to be valid UTF-8, hence I responded to @warpfork's doc about IPLD and strings, where he argues for strings as 8-bit byte sequences: https://gist.github.com/vmx/9eb56f525370d405bf5155a0aa5be3b9

@mvdan
 - bit of a short week, recorded a talk for golab and then did a live q&a for it today
 - short call to finish up HAMT spec changes we had been discussing
     - thank you Rod!
 - tried to switch go-ipld-adl-hamt over to the new spec
     - turns out no: the spec is invalid/inconsistent, will need to figure that out with Rod and Eric
 - otherwise continuing with tests and TODOs
 - filed a few of the simpler go-ipld-prime issues we had discussed with Eric

@rvagg
 - A Go week
 - Cleaning up some legacy go-* libraries, mainly go-cid, which is now freshly updated, with ~30% more test coverage and maybe needs a release (I need to figure out how that's been working)
 - go-dagpb on ipld-prime
 - HAMT spec work with @mvdan
 - Administrative stuff, including reviews

@mikeal
 - reviews
 - cleanup on dkv, blog post coming this week
 - giving a talk this week at Filecoin Liftoff

@ribasushi
 - Very little IPLD specific stuff last week around launch and external support
 - Shipped preliminary dumbodrop hard drive verifier (super preliminary version) https://github.com/ribasushi/fil-discover-check
     - Ensures you have mounted an actual Filecoin Discover drive
     - Ensures every found .car is well formed ( header readable / first 15 blocks are parseable / tail of file is readable )
     - Ensures every payload CID matches known datasets via bundling(!) the entire dynamo commp table
     - Ensures some spot-check commP's match the precomuted values, via a smaller reimplementation of fr32 dag-building

@warpfork
 - mostly a week full of not-IPLD tbh...
 - Strings specifications need to be hammered out.  I wrote a document: https://gist.github.com/warpfork/3aea1c0f60d0d27ab03d1bd24cc05f35
 	- The tl;dr of this is: "Strings SHOULD be UTF-8; however IPLD libraries MUST support the full range of 8-bit byte sequences without loss."
 	- Despite having such a simple summary it's an incredibly long document.  It drags through the details of that proposal; six distinct rationale; and a long series of alternatives that were also considered.
 	- These "rejected" alternatives may be worth review.  Some of them are more strongly rejected than others; some might be viable, but would need someone to actually pick up the idea and carry it through a fairly long and detailed specification process in order to become viable.
 	- If anyone does want to carry this in a different direction: I'd suggest picking one of those alternatives and doing the positive work to make it conceivably real.
 		- It's really, really easy to underestimate the difficulty of these and the potential for subtle conflicts of definition if you don't actually carry the idea all the way.

@chafey
  - off last week, resuming js-graphsync work

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

### Filecoin bytes string keys

https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/issues/1248 - "#1248 DealProposal's Label field serializes as non-UTF8"

Rust implementation is having trouble with Filecoin's use of arbitrary `string([]byte)` data and have encoded a field in DAG-CBOR as `string` but it contains non-UTF8 bytes. Do we have anything to add to this? The Rust folks want it changed, there _is_ scope to make some minor changes in a state update if there's a strong enough case for it.

Outcome:
 - historical on-chain data is "deal with it", it's just a fact now
 - we suggest the field be changed to `[]byte`, admitting that it's truly "arbitrary" as the spec says, then it'll be encoded in DAG-CBOR as `bytes` for future data

Additional notes:

  - a branching logic like "was string, is now byes" can be expressed with CDDL

### BTREE ADL

- Yes this should be done, but nobody has done it yet
- Looking at getting a contractor to build this
