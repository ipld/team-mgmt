## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - [Rust Multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash): all major changes from libp2p have been merged back. Next step, switch Rust libp2p to that version of the crate
 - Rust IPLD: I have a playground at https://github.com/vmx/rust-ipld to see what a Rust IPLD might look like from my perspective. I want to use it as a basis to have a discussion with other implementations (like https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipld) on what an official Rust IPLD should look like.
   - It can encode/decode the IPLD Data Model in DagCBOR (that was a tough fight with Serde. Having the enum with the Data Model Type definitions in a separate create makes it hard)
   - DagJSON shouldn't use Serde but encode/decode directly (https://github.com/vmx/rust-ipld/issues/1)

@warpfork
- I have my benchmarks I've been aiming to get!
	- Long story short: it confirms the interface redesign around "assemblers".  Things are *much* faster now, and asymptotically better alloc counts.
	- Building maps is at least 2x faster than the old system.
	- Iterating maps is something like 10x faster than the old system.
	- Benchmarks confirm iteration is now O(n)->O(1) allocs.  Great success.  Garbage collector pressure will be radically reduced.
	- Iterating the new maps is so fast it's actually faster than direct golang-native ranging over a map!  (yes, really.)
	- Good commit messages to check out for details and numbers, if interested:
		- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/commit/c209795fe0eeb59b2554f600dc6c7efbfc1ee588
		- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/commit/53fa8ac70eeed4246d5ca207ef6f552f062f8f7f
- In general: the above positive confirmatory results means this design will go forward.
	- Currently, this work is all in some "research" directories in a branch and off to one side; migrating the existing interfaces will take some work.
- Also: we've been discussing some spec issues around canonicalizing various things and strictness.
- Next: Kicking around some issues getting this to complete apply to structs.
	- I (re?)discovered some design challenges with recursive structure freezing today that in the case of codegen seem to require either a lot more generated types than I'd like, or a function pointer in a place I'm sad we can't inline things.  Engineer tears.  But these are tiny issues compared to the above improvements; will power through shortly.

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

 - CAR spec
   - @mikeal:
     - ship it (what we currently have in code), discuss details like CIDv1-only later
     - put the selector that created the CAR file into the CAR file
   - Put the version of the CAR file outside of the header
   - Make the header block consistent with the rest - CID prefixed
