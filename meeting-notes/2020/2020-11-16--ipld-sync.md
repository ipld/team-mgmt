## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Helping upstream users to upgrade to the latest rust-multihash and rust-cid versions
   - almost there: libp2p, forest
   - next: rust-ipld, ipfs-embedded, rust-ipfs,
 - (slightly related to IPLD) Getting rust code coverage tooling run smoothly
 - Next: Preparing talk for [Munich IPFS Meetp on Thursday 2020-11-19 18:00 UTC](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Munich-IPFS-User-Group/events/273882401/)

@mvdan 
 - merged first version of go-multicodec to master
     - second PR up to polish the API: https://github.com/multiformats/go-multicodec/pull/38
     - once reviewed+merged, will tag v0.2.0
 - go-ipld-adl-hamt continues
     - link loading/creation now works (added WithLinking methods)
     - now working on node copying
     - not clear what the API should look like for operations which modify nodes (and should copy them)
 - helping Eric review/merge ipld-prime changes (ongoing)
 - talking about the go build cache at a meetup tomorrow: https://www.meetup.com/Belfast-Gophers/events/273728022/

@rvagg
  - Filecoin data structures:
      - https://specs.ipld.io/data-structures/filecoin/chain.html
      - https://specs.ipld.io/data-structures/filecoin/messages.html
  - IPLD VSCode syntax highlighter (install from marketplace)
  - Miscelaneous extras

@willscot
  - IPLD Graphql is largely working. https://node.glif.io/service/statediff/graphql.html
    - Interface accessors still evolving
    - Notes on ipld.Node interface:
      - MapIterator/ListIterator don't lend themselves to cursors, or getting just keys / values
      - Scalars with presentation & binary view continue to be awkward
      - Interacting between schema-gen and non-schema-gen types are awkard
  - Prototyped HAMT as ipld.Node for faster loading

@riba
  - More work on the chain-capture: we have liftoff!
      - Capturing works, including coarse temporal data
      - Allows proper partitioning
      - Seems to work on nerpa, neeed to get mainnet started ( estimate ~ 5 days to complete once started )
  - More DumboDrop prep work :/

@chafey
  - js-graphsync
    - met with hannah on request validation
      - got some inspiration for a cleaner approach
    - started implementing the cleaner approach

@warpfork
- chats about hamts
- specs: we're working through the "Any" situation during the additional synchronous meeting on thursdays
- work in progress on go-ipld-prime codec revamps:
	- the goals of this are... several:
		- improve/normalize APIs and be able to do something about the linking API situation (#55);
		- get codec configurability towards a happier place;
		- more usable internal code (improved tokenization borders);
		- performance improvements, propbably (target of opportunity, but expected).
	- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/112
	- https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/101
- close-a-thon of other minor PRs:
	- convenience traversal function that selects links out of a tree: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/110
	- rot13adl demo quietly landed: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/98
- a short talk about IPLD, what's new, and where we're going: tomorrow!
