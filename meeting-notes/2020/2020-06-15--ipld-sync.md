## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD Block API almost done (still in review): https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipld/pull/46

@riba
 - Looked over the specification for URL-encoded selectors, with intent to use it on the lotus CLI
     - The spec won't work
     - The actual spec for selectors also has holes in terms of selector-to-a-point+recrursion
         - Separate exploration report on that pending towards end of month or so
     - In the meantime shipped a lite-pathing library to be used for the lotus CLI
 - Explored pigeon for parsing, but removed it as unnecessary complexity

@warpfork
 - ... almost typed my _name_ as "codegen", that was alarming
 - go-ipld-prime codegen dev branch recently landed to master!
     - most of the content work covered previously...
     - there's now a table for feature completeness: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/41db59c6c3c06bd7a94636fb72ea4c4d2f6dc8a6/schema/gen/go/README.md#completeness
 - did some exploratory quests with what it would be like to build applications using codegen
     - have some new questions to mull regarding using types across packages, having supersets of schemas, etc
     - backburning all of these thoughts again immediately, but good questions to be aware of for the future

@mikeal
 - js-multiformats
     - interface work is complete.
     - migrated to ESM
         - side quest regarding V8 native coverage
     - much improved action automation
     - all the dag-* codecs have been ported except dag-pb
     - plugins for every hashing function in multihashing-async
 - js-block
     - started migration to js-multiformats
     - nearly done. tests are passing w/ full coverage

@rvagg
 - btc docs, still wip, https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/270
 - zcash, minor progress
 - more cbor stricness https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/268 - single top level object, came from issue in borc (https://github.com/dignifiedquire/borc/issues/47), js-ipld-dag-cbor silently ignored extra, valid bytes


## Notes

 - Discussion abouth pathing in IPLD
 - Some discussion of encodings and paths, for consideration: https://gist.github.com/warpfork/82d4266074ef650b9efb118f475f2eef
 - Example from Peter in the chat: `const FixturePath = "Links/1/Hash/Links/1/Hash"`
