## Weekly Update

@vmx
  - Rust IPLD: working on getting Multiformats work with custom multicodec tables (one for Multihash, one for IPLD codecs):
    - https://github.com/multiformats/rust-cid/pull/50
    - https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash/pull/60

@mikeal
 - sick all last week :(
 - strange lambda limit with datastore-car
 - car completeGraph
 - graph store prototype in dagdb

@warpfork
- got all of the big refactor/perf/engine branch landed.  it's on master.
- it even includes the `pkg.Style.Map` syntax @rvagg asked for.
- spun up the work on codegen again.
	- tabula rasa rebooted it; getting up to where the going got tough last time went much, much faster this time.
	- some things are also improved incidentally (like there's more infra in place to support symbol renames later).
	- the amount of code needed for assemblers in the new interfaces is... large; this'll be a while.
- revisiting selector performance on some densely linked topologies together with @riba...
    - traversals where the path is part of the question are essentially an entity expansion; graphs with a dense mesh of links can yield k^n costs from the many different ways to reach the same place, all of which must be oonsidered.
    - just memoizing by the CIDs of links is Not Correct: it's possible for a select to say yes based on one path to get there, and yet no for another path.
    - several solutions possible, some easier, some more complete; still discussing where to go next

@chafey
 - a bit more hacking on the IPLD Schema Editor: https://chafey.github.io/ipld-schema-app/
   - mostly tweaking the prismjs color syntax highlighting rules 
 - found minor issue with hashmap schema
 - available to help!

@rvagg
 - IPFS import/export - review go-ipfs code by @ribasushi and implementing a JS version https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2745
     - needs tests, intention to copy fixtures from go-ipfs when that's finished
     - needs confirmation from IPFS team that they want this!
 - Diving into blockchains for Filecoin archival
     - working on BTC and Zcash atm
     - chains synced, planning next steps
     - will probably involve touching js-ipld-* libraries to fill them out a bit more for these codecs (noticing js-ipld-bitcoin is ~1/2 as complete as go-ipld-btc and even that's littered with TODOs)

@jonnycrunch
 - still working on IPID and verifiable credentials 
 - CBOR signed IPLD objects from RWoT paper: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/ipld-cbor.md
