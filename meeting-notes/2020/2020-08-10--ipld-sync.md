## Weekly Update

General:
 - CID:
   - The CID version is now a Multicodec:
     - https://github.com/multiformats/cid/pull/40
     - More discussions about it: https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/issues/49

@vmx
 - Rust Multihash:
   - Docs added to tiny-multihash: https://github.com/ipfs-rust/tiny-multihash/pull/7
   - Issues before upstreaming tiny-multihash: https://github.com/ipfs-rust/tiny-multihash/issues/5
 - JS IPLD:
   - Making js-ipld use Uint8Arrays instead of Node.js Buffers: https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld/pull/286
     - Thanks @achingbrain for doing all the hard work. I just reviewed, merged and did the releases.
     - js-ipld-bitcoin and js-ipld-ethereum are still using Node.js Buffers internally

@ribasushi
  - Still lost in Fil/dumbodrop testing/coordination
    - Due to focusing on "live chain" tests, everything is extraordinarily time consuming
  - Explored tinygo a bit, it looks promising but a number of simple pieces are missing, opening issues as I go
    - Focusing on tinygo for a bit as a workable wasm-producer, due to rust's multithreading story being... rough

@rvagg
 - HAMT-hunting, had my head in go-hamt-ipld for (nearly) Filecoin all week
     - docs (merged!) https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-hamt-ipld
     - inspecting and testing the `cleanChild()` collapse algorithm (turns out to be good, just looks quite different to how I'd think about doing it!)
     - cleaned up `cleanChild()` for clarity https://github.com/ipfs/go-hamt-ipld/pull/57
     - added a ton of block-load-time validation so it's got nearly zero chill about malformed blocks, it'll reject anything that doesn't smell right. Doing this involved manually writing lots of CBOR blocks that were malformed in various ways to push the validator around. https://github.com/ipfs/go-hamt-ipld/pull/59
     - ^ the above work with CBOR validation sets the stage for some block format changes, including:
         - https://github.com/ipfs/go-hamt-ipld/issues/54 the bitfield uses a smallest-possible big-endian byte array, which works but is difficult for cross-platform impl and making it a consistent size will aid in further validation (of `bitWidth`). I now have agreement that we should change to a fixed-length. Need to figure out if LE ordering would be best, I think that might match the HAMT we already have specced.
         - https://github.com/ipfs/go-hamt-ipld/issues/53 change a keyed union to a kinded union, saving bytes, simplifying the block format and reducing the possibility of bad blocks. Have agreement that this should be done.
 - Added a CBOR diagnostic format printer to my (yet unreleased) CBOR parser/encoder to help grok the internals in a CBOR block

@warpfork
 - HAMT-hunting is a good word for it
   - expanding benchmarks in the go-hamt-ipld libraries
 - go codegen now supports kinded unions!
 - review of go codegen completeness:
   - maps; lists; unions keyed and typed; structs as map and as tuple and as stringjoin; stringsbytesintsfloatsboolslinks, all the basics; this is a lot of things.
   - starting to use these things in "alpha" ways!
     - this is still generating more tests and fixes :) but becoming more and more exciting!

@mikeal
 - figured out how to store IPLD blocks in git+lfs
 - wrote a storage backend and feature for DagDB to use git+lfs for storage
 - wrote most of the ipjs build tool for universal JS
 - fixed some bugs and got the tests running again in js-multiformats
 - more docs for IPLD and DagDB

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

 - JS CID:
   - Get stuff from js-multiformats API into JS CID and print warning in JS CID if you use the old API (to have a smooth upgrade path)
