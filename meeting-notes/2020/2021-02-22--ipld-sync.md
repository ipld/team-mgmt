## Agenda

- General
  - Start recording
  - Start live stream
  - Find a notetaker
  - Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
  - Ask everyone to put their items that they've been working on the past two weeks (should be done prior to the meeting)
  - Ask for last minute agenda items
- This meeting
  - (@vmx) go-ipld-prime in IPFS:
    - Do you also deal with the IPFS Object API?
    - Do you think about deprecating IPLD Codecs like the Ethereum one (is there currently one?)?


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Done: Trying to get js-ipfs-unixfs use the [new JS DAG-PB Codec implementation](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-pb)
   - UnixFS part easy, hard part is js-ipfs as it uses the DAG (IPLD) API internally, which then also would need that update. But that update would then also include an upgrade to [js-multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats), which is tricky. It is a completly new API as has breaking changes for CIDs
     - Current idea: Do then encoding/decoding and storing of data within js-ipfs without using the current JS IPFS DAG API
 - Next: Continuing with that js-ipfs js-multiformats transition

@mvdan
 - json v2 experiment started being published at https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json
 - started doing research for ipld-prime-based ipfs node modifications
     - we're collecting notes for ipld in ipfs here: https://hackmd.io/KnC0cZGPRvSQG0g8Z9OMXw
     - will sync with Eric on the API design

@willscott 
 - Started on go-ipld-git for ipld-prime
 - helping figure out soping of work on ipld-prime integration into IPFS

@warpfork
- would like to think about fixture formats.  draft exploration report: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/357
- looking at that new json stuff @mvdan linked!  it's exciting.
	- we will probably be able to use this to make nicer dag-json in the future.
	- still thinking about if we can reuse the token concept here more widely (e.g. for dag-cbor)?  less likely.

@riba
- nothing this week / super-chaotic last week :(

@carsonfarmer
- Nothing specific this week from me (or Textile). Just came off a big 2-week "research" sprint around DIDs and threads, services.


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
- (@willscott) what is the distinction between https://github.com/ipld/go-codec-dagpb and https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime-proto
  - The answer is that `go-ipld-prime-proto` provides a prime view on top of the older ipld-format dag service, while `go-codec-dagpb` provides a native `ipld-prime` implementation of the dagpb codec.

- (@vmx) go-ipld-prime in IPFS:
  - Do you also deal with the IPFS Object API?
    - Adin is open to make changes to the API
    - @willscott will open issues about the Object and DAG API to talk about current uses, so that we can make decisions on how to move forward
  - Do you think about deprecating IPLD Codecs like the Ethereum one (is there currently one?)?
    - Vulcanize might look into Ethereum Codecs
    - @vmx will talk to JS IPFS folks about not upgrading the Ethereum Codec when moving to js-multiformats

- (@chafey) What about collisions in content-addressed data systems?
  - People have interest in creating colissions for Bitcoin wallets, they don't succeed. So have it happen by accident is even more unlikely
  - Talk about probabilities, e.g. in "nines" as in uptimes in SLAs
