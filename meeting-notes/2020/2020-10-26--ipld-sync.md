## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - IPLD Data Model:
   - To start a discussion: [Describing the Data Model a bit different than the current spec](https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/324):
     - Clear distinction between Data Model, programming language and codec
   - [exploration report about Data Model Map keys](https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/325)
     - Define the map key as its own thing, don't use existing kind
 - Rust Multiformats:
   - rust-multibase: Long overdue release of Base36 support (thanks @gozala for the review)
   - rust-multihash: No release yet :-/ I get this done this week, hopefully together with a rust-cid release

@rvagg
 - Some multicodec/multihash work
 - Some Go (go-dagpb) work
 - Some CAR work
 - Some JS Schemas work
 - https://github.com/rvagg/js-ipld-schema-describer to describe JS objects with IPLD Schemas
 - https://github.com/rvagg/js-ipld-schema-validator to build JS functions to validate JS objects according to IPLD Schemas
 - https://github.com/rvagg/car-to-schema to read a car, match against a library of IPLD Schemas and describe the remainder in IPLD Schema

@mvdan 
 - multiple review cycles of a contributor's go-multicodec package
     - See https://github.com/multiformats/go-multihash/issues/134
     - They took feedback well, code very close to being ready
     - Will incorporate into the upstream repo this week
 - more HAMT TODOs: supporting arbitrary values, supporting multiple hash algorithms, finish updating to the new schema
     - I expect to finish linking to other HAMT nodes this week
 - read the multiple strings and map keys docs from Eric and Volker (I think I understand the problem now)
 - filed a couple of issues to improve go-ipld-prime's Go code generation

@ribasushi
  - Little IPLD-specific work last week:
     - provided raw large-chain dumps for @rvagg and friends
     - various tests / observations / PoCs on the existing blockstores 

@willscott
  - [carbs](https://github.com/willscott/carbs) working as a read-only blockstore over a car file.
  - thinking about graphql serving / schema-generation derived from a go-ipld-prime schema

@mikeal
  - talk at Filecoin Liftoff
  - setup grant for BTree
  - carson did some great DagDB stuff that caused me to go and make some improvements

@chafey
  - js-graphsync
      - worked a bit on a message queue for aggregating requests/responses
          - complexity didn't seem worth the benefit/effort for now so decided to punt and create a new stream per request.
      - came up to speed on selectors (thanks to @warpfork)
          - a tutorial of some type would be super helpful, the spec is hard to grok (need examples)
          - useful: https://github.com/ChainSafe/ipld-traversal-vectors/blob/master/selector_walk.json
      - focus on requester logic and design
          - received blocks now being stored in block store with example app
          - started working on basic validation (depth-first blocks)
              - realized that validation is not possible without selector engine since go-ipfs requires depth limited recursive selectors
          - thinking through error handling api design, feeling ugly
          - discovered that js-multiformats is the "latest" home for CIDs (not js-cid)
              - prefix() deprecated, so need a local implementation (or a shared one in another lib)
      - Met with @mikeal to discuss api and am going to try out async generators/iterators
          - will clean up error handling
          - will make processing pipeline more flexible
          - will allow me to defer/move validation out of the core library  
          - will allow me to defer/move block creation out of the core library
          - Need some kind of queue structure to connect libp2p handlers to the generator - will try it-pushable

@warpfork

- advanced the rot13adl demo: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/98/
	- some "REVIEW" comments remain, where design discussions are nuzzled up against
- several codec hardening features in go-ipld-prime
	- added fixtures for regression tests for some of the budgeting/DoS issues fixed last week
	- merged them!
	- fixed unexpected panics around some malformed CIDs
	- thanks to those out there who fuzzed and reported these issues (LeastAuthority, bryanchriswhite, keks)
- made a fresh run on codec APIs and on reusable codec components: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/101/
	- attempts to make the user-visible codec APIs more consistent, better named, and be configurable in less baroque ways
	- makes a fresh run at an intermediate-level tokenization API, for making more code reusable
		- this is not unlike the existing systems, but moving the boundary of the token defn a little made some IPLD things simpler (hello, linking)
		- dag-json and dag-cbor would share a lot more code with this system
	- also includes the budgeting system as reusable and based on the token system
		- by contrast: this is currently re-implemented per codec, which is somewhat unfortunate.
	- work-in-progress, of uncertain prioritization.  but may be interesting to review already if the topic is interesting to you!
- helping out @chafey on absorbing selectors specs.
	- wishlist: integrate more examples into the docs for this.
	- wishlist: we should add documentation about what the IPFS APIs around selectors do, because it's very narrow and block-oriented, which is a very different kind of thinking than the selectors themselves do.
- we had additional meetings last week about docs&specs issues outstanding:
	- includes discussion about the vocabulary used around multiformats vs multicodecs vs etc
	- includes discussion about the specification of strings
	- notes in https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt/pull/102
- there's a very interesting discussion about ways to implement the Data Model in Rust: https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/323
	- this is taking a few different approaches than some others; enough to note in here I will not attempt to summarize :)
- I've made a subsequent document to continue exploring the string specification issue and how it affects the Data Model and codecs:
	- https://hackmd.io/79okuu4eQoedhpmgVbZboA
	- this factorizes the problem into two dimensions -- how we specify strings; and how we specify map keys -- and attempts to solve explicitly for all combinations of cases.
		- a two-dimensional table is a good way to handle this, because there are two choices that are quasi-separate to be made, but they very much relate to each other and define each other's consequences.
		- yes, that means a table with options AA through FC.  Bon app√©tit!
- spent a lot of time standing around gawking in awe at @rvagg's work this week, tbqh
