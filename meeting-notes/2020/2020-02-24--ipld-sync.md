## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Meeting with Rust Filecoin implementers
     - Full notes: https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt/blob/0f682b56aad03b8a5a054be5d8afe062e83a9d17/meeting-notes/2020/2020-02-13--rust-filecoin.md
     - Important bits for you folks:
         - I told them *not* to use or plan for a Rust IPLD yet (due to timeline constraints). Rust Filecoin only needs DagCBOR and they have code that already works. As long as they think and operate on the IPLD Data Model, it should be easy to replace their stuff with Rust IPLD once it is out.
 - Rust Multibase got a [major](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multibase/pull/16) [upgrades](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multibase/pull/17) by a third parties, supporting all base encoding types now
 - [Rust Multihash major API change](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash/pull/45) is close to being merged. I just wait one more day in case someone objects/wants to do another review
     - I already have a PR prepared for Rust libp2p to use this new version of Rust Multihash. This would mean the end of a > 1.5 years long running fork for Rust Multihash within libp2p2
 - Rust IPLD is no properly licensed under MIT/Apache 2.0
 - Proposed [Block API](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipld/issues/14) for Rust IPLD (which is similar to the js-block API)
 - Rust IPFS dev grant was [officially approved](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/tree/af1640612deb2760a11b011a88ae0beb39e41fae/open-grants/ipfs-rust)
 - Not done: Blog post about Rust IPLD/IPFS. I'll work with the Rust IPFS dev grant folks on one.
 - Next: Rust CID

@rvagg
 - CommP:
   - https://github.com/rvagg/rust-fil-commp-generate - still some adjusting needed, will incorporate https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/pull/1026 (pre merge) with anticipation that it will merge soon.
   - https://github.com/rvagg/js-fil-utils - helped me grok it, needs some tests but I’m also interested in expanding this to cover more of Filecoin.
 - Am participating in a Go training course this week and next

@creationix
 - Ready to merge draft spec for selector syntax
 - Still implementing parser to test out spec (zig lang)
 - Plan to write yet another parser/compiler in JS that integrates with existing JS libraries.
 - Plan to write syntax highlighers as needed to further test syntax.

@mikeal
 - finished out a few datasets (commp generated and stored)
 - numerous fixes and perf changes in the big data processing pipeline
 - some big changes are necessary to generate car files with 10K+ files in them, we're seeing timeouts
   after 10 minutes
 - side project: 
 - DagDB (database built on IPLD)

@warpfork

- Specifying Paths: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/47/files
	- tl;dr: we have some fun under-specified behavior around segments containing empty string, containing '/', etc...
	- maybe an interesting one for Tim, as a fan of grammars and somewhat related to selectors work?
	- tbc, I'm gonna merge this shortly, because it's a statement of truth about the library; but the discussion prompt should probably live longer than the PR.
- I wrote a glossary of type theory: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/242
	- Extends/replaces earlier short notes on "cardinality".
	- I hope it's helpful?
	- Has gotten a lot of comments already -- thank you!!
- Recommendations for Library Designers: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/241/files
    - From last week.  Should probably merge, afaict.
- Merged another three weeks worth of the long running core interface update branch.
	- Everything in there is now correctly factored apart into package trees.
	- Essentially ready to replace the interfaces on master.
	- Several more forward-looking design docs for codegen appeared as part of finishing the package splits.
		- See https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/530ccd6893ea4a528ffb0c7a3957754ed874be57/_rsrch/nodesolution/node/gendemo/HACKME_scalars.md
		- Gist of it: yep, codegen output packages really are going to stamp out their own scalars.  See pros and cons listed in the doc.
	- Ported codecs successfully to the new interfaces.
		- Performance gains again confirmed.  Some key operations in marshalling roughly doubled in speed.
			- On small datasets.  Expected larger on larger datasets.
			- See message on https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/commit/d3ddbfee00e1b02989fc70860cc65c1a01b06c60 for details.
	- Traversal package not ported yet; this is the one thing before the new interfaces replace the core interfaces on master.
		- Selectors use a 'fluent' API helper/wrapper.  This also needs porting.
			- I'm currently pausing to consider whether that helper API is actually worth keeping.  It might have been a misstep.
		- Wanted to get larger benchmarks established over old traversal before porting to new interfaces, but... might not be worth the effort.
			- Trying to write reusable benchmark code and corpus fixtures that works on both sides of the old and new interfaces is a chore.
			- Writing one-off corpuses on each side of the divide is also a chore.  Womp womp.
- Organizing benchmarks and corpuses is a continued challenge as the number of benchmarks and variations of targets increases.
	- Starting to do some deeper research on ways to manage this.
	- May end up writing some thin custom tooling for parsing benchmark results and composing them into suite reports.
