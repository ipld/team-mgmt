## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD: Block API is almost ready. Problem: IPLD also needs generics (like Rust CID)
 - DagJSON spec: One PR is still open https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/259
   - Controversial as current proposal only supports CIDv1
     - After discussion in this meeting:
       - Encode CIDv0 as Base58
       - Encode CIDv1 as Base32
 - Multicodec: @rvagg and I found agreement on how to move forward with the Filecoin multicodec:
   - https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/161#issuecomment-620995138
   - We still don't fully understand why this is needed, but we trust the Filecoin team on that decision
 - Next:
    - Get people interested in implementing Graphsync together (across languages)

@mikeal
- js-multiformats
  - nearly done, discussion about Buffer ongoing
- dagdb
  - indexes work is ongoing, last big feature push
  - added enum support to schema validator
  - fixed some a nasty bug in the Block API
- hiring stuff took up a bunch of time

@warpfork
- docs docs docs docs
  - landed "type theory glossary": https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/242 (long overdue)
  - landed "library design recommendations": https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/241 (long overdue)
  - `example*_test.go` files have started appearing in go-ipld-prime -- these have comments aimed at new users, and appear in online documentation
- kicked around the link API design problem a bit again
  - notes generated: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/55
- 'go-car', 'go-graphsync', and 'go-ipld-prime-proto' libraries all on the latest major generation of go-ipld-prime!

@rvagg
- multiformats: 3 PRs to the table for Filecoin, they are ready, we're not 100% comfortable but that's OK and we should probably code that into the docs about what multiformats is about
- btc:
    - Full round-trip; decode into native bitcoin structures and re-encode into raw block format to match exact bytes. Tested across entire chain, found lots of novelty but solved it.
    - Moving on to IPLD frontends for this work - need 3 codecs for this, will use the new @ipld/block and Mikeal's new multiformats frontend work as the interface rather than the old IPLD codec interface.
    - Upstreaming a change to the bitcoin API https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18826
