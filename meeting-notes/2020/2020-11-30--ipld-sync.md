## Agenda

  - @vmx: Inline CIDs (and [DAG-JOSE](https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269))
    - Inline CIDs support transparent pathing even over different IPLD codecs. Can we provide something similar with the current Schemas?


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Storage system for content addressable data: https://github.com/vmx/storethehash

@mvdan 
 - released go-multicodec v0.2.0
     - actually ran into a Go proxy/sumdb bug and raised https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42809 after talking to other Go devs at PL who ran into the same issue (Marten, Ian)
     - replacing old constants with the lib as I go
 - planned releases 0.6 and 0.7 with Eric
     - mainly deciding what breaking changes to do in 0.7
     - helped with some reviews/merges, the bigger rewrites will be iterated on in master
     - currently working on automation to update code for the first and biggest API breakage, `AsFoo` errors
 - got nerdsniped by Adin about a common bug in go-ipfs
     - `v, ok := someMap[i].(someType)` is easy to misread and misuse
     - thread: https://protocollabs.slack.com/archives/CE9R3H6FK/p1606283477277500
     - Go proposal draft came out of it: https://hackmd.io/SDPVsOWeQ7uLmjlxvlxtug
 - my upstream "Go best CI practices" stalled :(

@mikeal
  - s/mikltrees/chunk-trees
      - cid set
      - sparse array
      - ordered map
      - db index
  - thanksgiving

@warpfork
 - working on accumulating some known goals for 2021 so we can circulate this info to anyone who wants to align on plans on that scale: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UyC6VWUQzbTUfj3lLeKcITP_7vWBcgfhmYqww7UVt_s/edit#
 - lots of smol merges
 - this week: will be finishing up those, or deferring them, and tagging go-ipld-prime v0.6
 	- will be backtracking to fill in a changelog for all the things that have already gone into this
 	- v0.6 should be a safe checkpoint
 - we'll be moving forward to do a bunch of API changes after this, which will become v0.7, and *will* require intervention from downstreams to upgrade across.
	- the aim of these will be usability improvements to core interfaces based on feedback gathered from our integrations and use so far.
	- we will aim to knock these out quickly.  Hoping to make this next version available within a month; want new users in the new year to get this experience.
 - does it not bother any of you that we start these bullet points one-space indented and that actually really fucks with the editor and its highlighting and makes a huge mess?
 - it bothers me literally every week i don't know how yall don't wig out on this

@rvagg
 - Filecoin data, so much data, trying to deal with the volume in a practical way
 - Other filecoin related data structure things (mainly Actors related)

@riba
 - Dumbodrop start for real (first sector is being assemmbled as we speak)
 - Slinging 

@chafey
 - js-graphsync
   - implemented hard coded validation of graph

## Notes

### Inline CIDs

Outcome of the discussion: We need a document talking about the trade-offs of using inline CIDs
