## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD: still working in the [Block API](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipld/issues/14). Problems:
   -  Make IPLD generic over the code tables
   -  Getting a codec based on the code
     -  Solution: don't get the full codec, but just have a trait that enables enconding/decoding the data model 

@warpfork
- go codegen progress: lists and maps both now work, fully recursively, *including* representational mode
    - previously there was a big todo: traversing recursive structures in representation mode would "forget" that they were in representation mode
    - now: this means you can get `theNode.Representation()` at the root of a large tree of data, and pass that to regular codec marshal methods, and it all transparently DTRT!
    - there's now a table in the readme which shows all the progress on individual features, with checkmarks and such shiny:
- many more documentation in go-codegen.  (now exceeding 100k of README and HACKME files.  There's a lot to describe!)
- byte range selectors discussion: https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/265

@rvagg
 - All Bitcoin
   - https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-bitcoin/pull/63 - the bulk of the IPLD work, the repo has been entirely reworked and we're going to move it to a new repo, maybe ipld/js-bitcoin, and publish as @ipld/bitcoin
   - https://github.com/rvagg/js-bitcoin-block - the block encode and decode work, has iterated a bit as I found unicorns across the blockchain, can now do the entire blockchain
   - https://github.com/rvagg/js-bitcoin-extract - utilities to extract the data from Bitcoin Core, verify my code works with the blocks, pack them up into IPLD blocks, consolidate them into 1Gb CAR files and verify that the blockchain can still be fully extracted
   - https://github.com/ipld/js-datastore-car/pull/7 - extensions for the JS CAR utility to help this work, including being able to treat a CAR file as a random-access read-only store by pre-indexing the blocks and their locations
   - https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/176 - add 0xb2 for bitcoin-witness-commitment, the 3rd codec needed to make this work

@ribasushi
 - Base36 is now a thing
   - https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/pull/65
   - Background about why it's needed: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7318
 - Still working on [DAGger](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/DAGger/)
