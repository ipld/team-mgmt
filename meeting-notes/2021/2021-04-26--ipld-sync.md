## Weekly Update

@warpfork
- working on some docs and site stuff
	- Using https://fleek.co/ for publication -- neat service.  Very smooth to get something out the door, stores in IPFS, easy to integrate with Github, etc.
- spending some time with the ResNetDev research team seeking alignment between ipld and smart-records
- otherfolk:
	- @mvdan has started a seekret project to work on golang reflective binding to user-defined structs.  This could provide a lower-friction way to work with IPLD in golang.

@rvagg

    * multiformats 7.0.0
    * @ipld/dag-pb 1.0.0

Textile deep dive talk from last week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mHBWtrV_vc


Compiling ADL Selectors to Data Model Selectors, is that possible?
 - @warpfork, @vmx: no
   - Though not ADL, but Schema Selectors to Data Model Selector should be possible

And more things, watch the video if you're interested :)
