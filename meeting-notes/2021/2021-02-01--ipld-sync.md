 - Next:
   - hackweek: Jitsti through libp2p

@mvdan 
- Finally got go-ipld-adl-hamt and go-hamt-adl to produce the same bytes!
- Hackweek project: "pure" Go IPFS desktop without Electron

@mikeal
- Implemented a workaround in ipjs for this very annoying rollup bug https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/781
- 

@ribasushi
 - Nearly Done: SQLotus
     - Ran into a number of issues storing/backfilling large dataset
 - Next:
     - Hackweek: assist Adin&co with the retrieve-by-manifest ("SID") PoC
     - Re-run the SQLlotus backfil

@willscott
 - statediff / schema updated to v3 (with caveats)

@rvagg
 - DAG-JSON impl and spec https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/356
 - Tinkering with Mikeal's encryption primitives and related pieces @ https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/349 & https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/pull/59

@carsonfarmer
  - Tinkering with Mikeal's IPSQL SQLProofs as a CRDT
      - Related to some of my own merkle-crdt work
  - Releasing 3 JS for testing p2p systems: libp2p-bundle, libp2p-rpc, clocks.
  - More to come: libp2p-fetch, IPLD diffs
  - Textile exploring new primitives for access tokens that uses IPLD

@jonnycrunch
 - W3C DID update:
   - DAG-CBOR is out of the DID Core spec
   - Maybe there will be a registry for serializations, though that's not the correct place for such things
