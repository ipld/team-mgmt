## Weekly Update

@warpfork
- started using IPLD Schemas and `bindnode` in a project this weekend and... it's nice.
   - made some fixes to bindnode as I went (https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/226/)
   - it's... letting me write the APIs I want to write.  Feelsgood.
- the absolutely massive effort to start getting go-ipfs renovated to use go-ipld-prime appears on the verge of landing: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/7976 ...!

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD (`libipld`) is looking for co-maintainers: https://github.com/ipfs-rust/libipld/issues/112
 - [Nym](https://nymtech.net/) is looking for Rust IPLD folks, so if you're interested, get it touch with them


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
