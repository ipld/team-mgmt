## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

@willscott talking about possible short-cuts to have IPLD Selectors for Advanved Data Layouts (ADLs) and asks about ideas.
 - Getting into signalling for IPLD Schemas
 - @mvdan: How do you signal e.g. different HAMT implementations?
 - @ribasushi: A hard-coded selector (not full blown ADL enabled), might solve already a lot of cases
 - @mvdan: Is there a way to attach metadata to Filecoin deals
