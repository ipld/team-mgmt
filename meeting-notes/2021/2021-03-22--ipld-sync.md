@vmx
 - js-ipfs to js-multiformats work paused until [
chore: upgrade deps with new typedefs
#3550](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/3550) is merged.
   - Currently HEAD js-unixfs does not work with HEAD js-ipfs, after this merge it does
   - Need some plan for moving forward after the end of Q1

@warpfork
- proposing a roadmap for unixfsv1-seen-as-ADLs: https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/pull/3
	- There's about 4 or 5 distinguishable ADLs in here.  (Maybe more than you would've thought?)
	- Would love review on if these make sense to folks.

@willscott 
- (non-dag)-json/cbor codecs
