## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

 - @warpfork: we should think about test fixture formats again
   - If anyone reading this knows about a format that is supported by many languages, please let us know. See the ["let's talk about how we do fixtures" exploration report](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/9bab36f7c256ae8ff14e0190ff0327e631ef2e15/design/history/exploration-reports/2021.02-cross-language-fixtures.md) for more information about the requirements.
   - @mvdan: Use a better languange and generate JSON out of it, which is then consumed by the testing libraries
