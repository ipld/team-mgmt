## Weekly Update

@mvdan
 - first big chunk of schema-schema nearly done at https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/253
     - will spend another 1h later this week to wrap it up for merge
     - full `ipld.LoadSchema` to parse and compile is about a day's work away
 - haven't done work on bindnode in a while; seems to work as well as a PoC can be expected to?
     - might spend part of the next rotation improving it a bit

@willscott
 - small progress on car ingestion / creation
 - ipld-prime-in-ipfs mostly released
 - work is beginning on partial dags in graphsync. eventually should think about work stealing in that context.

@vmx
 - rust-multihash: make `Read`/`Write` with no-std (help review): https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash/pull/138

@warpfork

- reminders of cool recent news...
   - go-ipld-prime release v0.11.0
      - codecs force sorting on you now
      - and a bunch of other things

   - go-ipld-prime release v0.12.0
      - the `datamodel` package is now a subpackage.  major refactor.
      - the root `ipld` package is now able to start containing helper functions for high level behaviors that bring together features from *all* of the subpackages of the repo.
         - right now it's mostly aliases -- we're aiming to make this a very smooth transition.

   - testmark!  It's a test fixtures format
      - in Golang: https://github.com/warpfork/go-testmark
      - in JS: https://github.com/rvagg/js-testmark
      - you'll start seeing it in fixtures

- a roadmap issue for unixfs-as-ADLs: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/258

- an IPLD CLI has begun
   - going for a "jq" vibe.
   - and super heavy tests and examples and docs from the start.
   - exact behaviors?  your suggestions welcome.

- go-datalark: https://github.com/ipld/go-datalark
   - use IPLD from Starlark -- read and write data and play programmatically in an interpreted language

@rvagg
 - Lots of minor supportive work, across both Go and JS
 - Getting a lot more familiar with go-ipld-prime's usage - including contributing on go-ipfs work, selectors, and other
 - https://github.com/ipld/codec-fixtures for cross-codec testing of fixture edge cases
