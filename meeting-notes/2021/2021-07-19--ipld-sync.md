## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

- CAR stuff:
   - CIDs...
      - the multihash vs CID thing comes up again.
      - index is multihash-based.
   - deduplication...
      - it's not quite free, but also you probably do want it by default?
      - does it need a safety check?  if you allow repeats, the index will seek to the first one.
         - so if the second one is a different value, that's bad news.
      - some folks have requested Put operations should deduplicate by CID _and not_ by multihash.
      - default is to deduplicate by multihash, can turn it off if you want.
         - there's a mode for deduplicate by CID, too.

- Some folks joined us :D
   - Wanting to put the golang HAMT ADL to work.
      - Could use some more examples.
      - Also especially for coupling to CARs.
         - Quick answer: right now it is recommended to use NewSelectiveCar API of go-car v1 in order to work with ipld-prime style Nodes.
         - Agreed more examples and more API smoothing could be desirable here
