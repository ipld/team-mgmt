## Weekly Update

@warpfork
- this week's big thing: storage API revisit!
   - https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/265
   - a simple API aiming for minimal first.
      - only stdlib types -- for ease of implementing without complex dependency tangle.
      - feature detection for extensability.
      - focus on what content-addressable lets us do well (e.g. presume write-once).
      - PR has more info on what this is trying to improve on.
   - includes backcompat to `ipfs/go-datastore` (i.e., where most of the actual storage implementations are right now).
   - not a breaking change, broadly speaking.  (lots of new interfaces, but it's optional to use them.)
- the CLI gadget I've been working on has a new repo: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipldtool
   - aim is: a "jq-like" tool that brings joy, and is easily to use in a playful, exploratory way.
   - coming along, but slowly.  (it's dragging other features and fixes in the go-ipld-prime library forward, as well, as it goes.)

@rvagg
- Lots of Lotus (Filecoin) + CAR + selector work
- Trying to get deeper into go-graphsync, chewing off some easier TODOs and learning as I go
- Updating DAG API for js-ipfs stack (http client being most important because it has wide use) to match go-ipfs 0.10 changes we did for go-ipld-prime

@vmx
 - rust-multihash
   - new release: Scale codec works as expected
   - help needed: get hasher from code: https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash/issues/141

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

From the community: someone's implemented quite a lot of Selectors and Data Model stuff in JS recently!
Check out https://github.com/myelnet/myel.js/blob/dev/packages/myel-client/src/selectors.ts !

wishlist: gathering a list of rust repos: could we get a PR to this area? https://github.com/ipld/ipld/tree/master/libraries
