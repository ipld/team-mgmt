## Agenda

- General
  - Start recording

  - Ask everyone to put their items that they've been working on the past two weeks (should be done prior to the meeting)
  - Ask for last minute agenda items
- This meeting
  - Questions (@biglep):
    - What is driving the rust-ipld work right now?
    - How much of your time is devoted to this vmx? (no pressure - just curious)
    - Is rust-ipld testing against some of the test fixutres that have been getting created last year that JS and Go are using
  - _add your agenda item_


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust multiformats: lot's of stuff on the `next` branches
   - const generics
   - better no_std support
 - Rust IPLD:
   - Trying to use Serde:
     - Serde as (de)serialization framework, not because of existing data format implementations
     - CIDs will need custom (de)serializers in order to work as expected

@mvdan
 - improvements in ipld-prime driven by GraphSync
     - add support for enums in bindnode
     - also support binding int-repr enums with Go integers
     - add support for `any` in schemas and bindnode
     - rough bench numbers: bindnode+dagcbor seems to be ~2.5x as slow as protobuf-go, not too bad given we haven't optimized bindnode yet
 - looks like GraphSync is on track to using IPLD for their new protocol version
 - will be going through the backlog of bindnode and schema bugs reported

@biglep
 - While not IPLD specific (but IPLD is part of it) focused on recruiting and having more of our conversations out of PL slack and into public channels.  Next up after that is ensuring 2022 roadmaps are created and public.

@rvagg
 - Minor things in JS-land
     - js-multiformats types fixes (Gozala did most of the work) and publishing errors needing a bit of a scramble
 - go-ipld-prime - some playing with bindnode thanks to go-graphsync messaging migration
     - some bindnode problems found (for mvdan to play with):
         * recursives don't properly report their length if they have `nil` elements, causing encoding problems with cbor maps.
         * can't unmarshal into a struct containing a *cid.Cid (ptr) properly - still some work needed on optionals and nullables
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/333 - tighter cbor generation rules for recursive length (maps) - a map's reported length must be the same as the number of elements
 - Would like to talk about migrations and optimisations for the go-graphsync message schema: https://github.com/ipfs/go-graphsync/blob/rvagg/uuid-rebasing/message/ipldbind/schema.ipldsch
     - Can/should we make this more efficient (moar tuple?)
     - How should we consider versioning when we have the ability to switch on version at the protocol level, we could also do it with the schema and have a stable protocol version


## Notes

 - Questions (@biglep):
   - What is driving the rust-ipld work right now?
     - Filecoin Virtual Machine
   - How much of your time is devoted to this vmx? (no pressure - just curious)
     - A lot at the moment, but winding down a bit.
   - Is rust-ipld testing against some of the test fixutres that have been getting created last year that JS and Go are using
     - Once released it will pass the codec fixtures we have
