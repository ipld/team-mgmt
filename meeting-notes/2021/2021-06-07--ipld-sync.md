## Weekly Update

@mvdan 
 - good progress on IPLD reflection
     - refactored tests, running against both schema/gen/go and node/bindnode
     - now extending the tests while fixing the corresponding bindnode TODOs
     - will add more examples and share an "alpha version" by Wednesday
 - quality of life improvement issues filed:
     - "node to basic Go value": https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/178
     - schema.TypedPrototype: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/181
     - basicnode.Chooser: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/185
 - can we finish the schema parsing stuff?
     - schema.TypeSystem stands out as the most verbose part of bindnode examples
 - can we add a selector parsing API from string, similar to regexp.Compile?
     - the "builder" API is powerful, but tricky to use for simple use cases
     - would be neat to implement encoding's TextMarshaler and TextUnmarshaler too, which would e.g. [enable using them as flags](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45754)

@warpfork
- docs+specs consolidation and update sitrep:
	- The master branch on https://github.com/ipld/ipld/ now points to the new content!  (Old content is still reachable in git history, don't worry.)
	- Pending on DNS update, but https://ipld.io/ should be pointing to the new content soon.
	- (The docs.ipld.io DNS entry will not change yet -- though at some point we should figure out what to do there.)
	- Content work will continue until morale improves`^W^W` all "todo" blocks are gone.  (Yes, there are still "todo" blocks.  The criteria for launch here is "more comprehensive than before", not "perfect".)
	- An additional challenge coming up will be updating old repos with notices about how and where to contribute in the future.

@rvagg 
    - Recorded IPLD moduile for ResNetLab
    - js-car & go-car tests and fixes for version detection and proper header format - in prep for CARv2 work
    - [js-dag-jose](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-dag-jose/) updates - dependencies (latest multiformats), API, examples, oh my!
    - (older) dag-json spec cleanup finally merged @ https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/block-layer/codecs/dag-json.md
    - (older) also shipped big new update to js-dag-json (`@ipld/dag-json`) fully spec compliant and strict, very nice
    
@riba
    - Got basic text to pathing-selector library out and wired it up to filecoin retrievals
        - Hoping to get some momentum going re "code that is easier to work with"

@warpfork part 2
- Hey, is anyone interested in test fixtures?  I drafted a new format.
	- Example of new format: https://gist.github.com/warpfork/4a638a577dd9bb18cafe4a7d4de1db4b
	- Contrasting example of same content in json: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChainSafe/ipld-traversal-vectors/master/selector_walk.json
	- I've implemented this as a PoC in golang.  I'm undecided if this is worth pushing forward and would love some first impressions.
	- You can read more about the format here: https://github.com/warpfork/go-taffy
	- Earlier requirement discovery document here: https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/042ab16c683ce6a585e5d3eac2d037f4e6472f2c/notebook/exploration-reports/2021.02-cross-language-fixtures.md
