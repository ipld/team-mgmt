## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Done:
   - going all in on js-multiformats for js-ipfs-unixfs: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/pull/116
     - Fixed some types. It's now using only the "Block API", which is like a `BlockService`, but has only `put()` and `get()`
 - Next: see if using js-multiformats (and removing js-ipld) from js-ipfs-unixfs also works out when using it withing js-ipfs

@mvdan
 - continuing the move from go-ipld-prime-proto to go-codec-dagpb
 - did go-merkledag, go-car, go-graphsync
 - wrangling go-ipfs at the moment

@warpfork
- go-multihash registration system, surely close to landing: https://github.com/multiformats/go-multihash/pull/136
- LinkSystem (https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/143) chilling out, waiting for above
- how should we expose API to let some storage be "trusted" (i.e. don't check the hash)?  Discussing in https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/149

@willscott 
- git codec [passes tests](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-git/pull/46)
- interface of [go-fetcher](https://github.com/ipfs/go-fetcher/blob/main/fetcher.go) is cleaner now
- there's a unixfs [ipld-prime node](https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode) now \o/

@rvagg
- multiformats and other projects using ipjs for build & publish - getting `"main"` into published package.json because esbuild doesn't support export maps (!) and large parts of the PL JS stack has decided to integrate esbuild (via aegir). Whacking moles to make this work, TypeScript the current problem but a solution seems possible. https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/pull/66

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

- wider topic: Did You Know?  Repo counts on IPFS/IPLD/libp2p/multiformats/PL orgs.  Over >700.
	- @rvagg believes we probably have plenty of things we could archive (or... something) if we had an agreed strategy for that!
	- @willscott points out this conversation should probably try to keep an eye on heavily-depended-upon repos that might live under personal accounts!
