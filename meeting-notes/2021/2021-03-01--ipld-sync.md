- This meeting
  - (mvdan) update and questions about go-codec-dagpb for go-merkledag


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Done:
   - going all in on js-multiformats for js-ipfs-unixfs: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/pull/116
     - Abstraction to encode and store data (js-ipld) is indeed quite nice, I guess we need something similar for js-multiformats
 - Next: see if using js-multiformats (and removing js-ipfs) from js-ipf-unixfs also works out when using it withing js-ipfs

@warpfork 
 - Exploration report on fixture formats still accepting any comments: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/357
 - LinkSystem (https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/143) still hasn't officially landed, but is probably fine to build on.
 - Going to attempt to move some of the mulithash registry stuff drafted as part of LinkSystem back up into go-multihash.

@mvdan 
 - not much to report this week, but I will talk about go-codec-dagpb later :)

@willscott 
 - git codec [update to ipld prime](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-git/pull/46) could use a review
 - There is a [go-fetcher](https://github.com/ipfs/go-fetcher) implementation of the fetching part of go-merkeldag based on ipld-prime now



## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

  - (mvdan) update and questions about go-codec-dagpb for go-merkledag
    - which implementation to use
    - @rvagg's implementation is stricter and errors on some of the existing tests, but do those tests matter in real world?
    - More context in last weeks notes: https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt/blob/be4212bd15872abd5313f36c19c6888c1e5536ca/meeting-notes/2020/2021-02-22--ipld-sync.md#notes
    - (@carsonfarmer) Some edge cases for DAG-PB might be here: https://github.com/ipfs/js-dag-service

  - Questions:
    - (@carsonfarmer) Are there Go implementations of the chunky tree stuff (which exists in JS)?
      - Not that we know of.
      - @carsonfarmer: we likely do a minimal implementation of it in Go
      - @warpfork: you could use https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-adl-hamt as a basis for code organization
