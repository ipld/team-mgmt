## Weekly Update

@mvdan 
 - IPLD reflection "alpha 1" ready in master
     - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime@master/node/bindnode
     - Three core APIs: Prototype, Wrap, Unwrap
     - Supports inferring Go types from schemas
     - Now implementing inferring schemas from Go types
     - Will attempt to make the default behavior match cbor-gen; otherwise, add a "CborGen" opt-in to mimic its behavior
 - quality of life improvements:
     - schema.TypedPrototype and basicnode.Chooser are in master
     - "node to basic Go value" is next
     - Would still love predefined selectors for common operations like SelectAll... but need some guidance

@warpfork
- https://ipld.io/ is fully shipped, ya'll
	- :tada:
	- Also includes a beautiful splash page again, thanks to olizilla.
- Proposed some foot-gun avoidance changes to go-ipld-prime codecs around 'absent': https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/196
	- Also discussion of larger context on that: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/191
	- tl;dr we hoped to pull off 'absent' in a way that adds clarity, but landed in sticky areas.  Concept still fairly sound: golang experience of it questionable.
	- Wish we could have codecs work either side of the typesystem "lens", because that would make sense and be cool, but it does leave some traps laying around.

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

- getting good error messages out of applications of schemas is really high value.
	- Rod's detecting this.
		- Example: dag-pb has a bunch of manual error handling that's helpful.

- discussion
	- observation: the absent-produces-error thing will still result in errors appearing "later".  Data-dependent.
		- removing the coersion means not doing the _wrong_ thing -- so better -- but the error appearing after deployment is still possible/likely, which means it's still very annoying.
	- 
	- option: wrap nodes in another proxy object that hides the `.Representation()` method if you really want to work at type-level view.
		- is a hack option, but one to consider.


## Selectors discussion

 - @ribasushi: what can I replace this with today?
    - `func SelectorSpecFromPath(path Expression, optionalSubselectorAtTarget builder.SelectorSpec) (builder.SelectorSpec, error) {...}`
 - @warpfork: plain ipld.Nodes, for now, in the future we can leverage bindnode
 - Example insides: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-selector-text-lite/blob/master/parser.go#L83-L86
 - Try the qp work Hannah started: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/194
