## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Done: -
 - Next: getting js-ipld/js-ipfs to use [js-multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats)

@warpfork 
- go-ipld-prime LinkSystem work: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/143
- missing multihashes: https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/206
- it would be really nice to do a close-a-thon of any open specs and docs PRs soon.
	- I would like to push ahead with consolidations as discussed in https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/93 soon, and keeping open PRs intact across that is gonna be unfun.

@riba 
- github.com/filecoin-project/go-bs-postgres-chainnotated should appear on a github near you mid-week (doing one more pass on docs/todo-nits)
    - ( it works, to the point where a cold-start, PG included, starts up faster than a wamr-badger-lotus )

@rvagg
 - minimal IPLD this last week due to internal reorg spinup
 - some work on spec-actors v3 upgrade diff for specs repo update and sync with statediff

@willscott 
 - Scoping what work is needed for go-ipld-prime in ipfs. (deprecating and replacing go-ipld-format)

@yourname
 - _add what you've been working on_


## Notes

@chafey talks about [Amazon Ion](https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/):
  - in JS it has getters for types and not directly plain JS objects as currently the JS IPLD Codecs are doing
  - has two representations a text and a binary one
  - it has streamer decoders, you can then e.g. put important data first and terminate early

@vmx: How to proceed with SoftWare Heritage multicodecs: https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/203
  - @vmx asks them if it we should keep it open or if they need a decision

@riba: Ownership of mutability of IPLD blocks in Go
  - @riba: the mutability is not clear in the current stack
  - @riba: Somewhat pertinent to new push on cleanups:
  ```
        // RawData returns the block data payload. When AssumeUserNeverMutatesBlockdata
        // is true (the default) the data-slice is returned as-is, without copying
        func (sb *StoredBlock) RawData() (data []byte) {

            var err error
            data, err = sb.inflatedContent()
            if err != nil {
                return nil
            }

            if !AssumeUserNeverMutatesBlockdata {
                data = append(
                    make([]byte, 0, len(data)),
                    data...,
                )
            }

            return
        }
  ```
  - @warpfork: documentation is sadly the best tool
  - @willscott: you could use read-only pages in OS memory (`madv`). They are expensive, but you could use them on car files and make them mmapped read-only.

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
