## Weekly Update


@vmx
 - js-multiformats transition:
   - JS-IPFS tests pass when using the [js-multiformats based UnixFS](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/pull/116) https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/3556

@warpfork
- go-ipld-prime release v0.9.0 tagged: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/releases/tag/v0.9.0
	- this includes all the LinkSystem stuff -- it's finally landed :tada: 

@otherfolks!
- working on making unixfsv1 legible as an ADL: https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode
	- super cool
	- may see more of these, unsure
- in the crossover and connecting of ipld to ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/go-fetcher/
	- this is work on some new extraction of fetching concepts, based on ipld-prime and cleaning them up
- go-graphsync updating to the go-ipld-prime LinkSystem changes: https://github.com/ipfs/go-graphsync/pull/161
	- large diff but semantically pretty smooth

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

Other news:

 - [ipfs-embed](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed) (a partial Rust implementation of IPFS) is Bitswap compatible with go-ipfs
