## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust libraries section is a thing: https://ipld.io/libraries/rust/

@warpfork
- go-ipld-prime storage APIs continue to advance.
	- This probably seems really boring, but it's also an important piece that was missing for a long time, and holding people back on older APIs.  Clearing the road here is a big deal.
	- There are now adapters to all of these older APIs: go-datastore, go-blockstore, go-blockservice.
		- That gives you access from the whole gammut of things from flatfs to bitswap.
	- The latest PR also introduces a new clean implementation that's on-disk compatible with flatfs, but about _40% faster_, and similarly reduced alloc counts.
		- No optimization work has been performed on this.  The ceiling may be considerably higher!
- from others, some highlights:
	- there is a CLI tool that can do golang schema codegen!  Thanks Adin: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipldtool/pull/1
	- an increeeedible amount of progress on bindnode from mvdan.
		- It's now *much* easier to use -- and checks that your golang types are valid immediately instead of panicking late in life.  Huge win.
	- an increeeedible amount of progress on the schema DSL parser and compiler from mvdan.
		- Most representations are now supported.

@rvagg
 - DAG API updates for the js-ipfs stack https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/3917 to match go-ipfs v0.10 changes
 - Interesting discussion re identity multibase in JS being able to preserve bytes in round-trip - likely a case where we can say utf8 doesn't need to apply
     - https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/issues/122

@willscott 
 - Car [CLI](https://github.com/ipld/go-car/tree/master/cmd/car) can create car files from unixfs directory trees!
 - [Legs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-legs/pull/23) can synchronize ipld dags over HTTP

@jonnycrunch
 - w3C DID and verifiable credentials, smart health cards for covid credentials
 - plain CBOR (application/did+cbor) https://www.w3.org/TR/did-cbor-representation/
 - super excited about ipld-wasm work!
 - data modeling using ipld into machine learning pipelines
