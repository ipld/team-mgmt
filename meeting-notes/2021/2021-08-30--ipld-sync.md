## Weekly Update

@yourname
 - _add what you've been working on_

@warpfork 

- go-ipld-prime release v0.11.0
   - codecs force sorting on you now
   - and a bunch of other things

- If you haven't heard: go-ipfs now uses go-ipld-prime internally in many places.
   - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/7976 is the mega PR.
   - There's still work to go in renovating all pieces (some use facades that we hope are transitionary), but it's great progress.

- go-ipld-prime `node/bindnode` is getting better and better and better and...!

- go-ipld-prime release v0.12.0
   - the `datamodel` package is now a subpackage.  major refactor.
   - the root `ipld` package is now able to start containing helper functions for high level behaviors that bring together features from *all* of the subpackages of the repo.
      - right now it's mostly aliases -- we're aiming to make this a very smooth transition.

- testmark!  It's a test fixtures format
   - in Golang: https://github.com/warpfork/go-testmark
   - in JS: https://github.com/rvagg/js-testmark
   - and in use in the IPLD Specs:
      - Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipld/ipld/45489ee14e88a3e82e28da456eea15fa3b9e90d6/specs/selectors/fixtures/selector-fixtures-1.md
      - Rendered: https://ipld.io/specs/selectors/fixtures/selector-fixtures-1/
      - Used: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/5c39e6803594f599a85d2545ad72faf584bf6f19/traversal/selector/spec_test.go#L29-L39
   - I guess this is the eventual culmination of a quest started in https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/042ab16c683ce6a585e5d3eac2d037f4e6472f2c/notebook/exploration-reports/2021.02-cross-language-fixtures.md .

- there are motions to get dag-jose added to go-ipfs default installations.
   - it seems like we'll be working towards this -- carefully and with heavily emphasis on tests and fixtures.
   - issue to watch: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/8364
