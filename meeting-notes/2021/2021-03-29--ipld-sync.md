## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Still working on js-multiformats integration into js-ipfs-unixfs/js-ipfs
   - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/pull/116
   - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/3556
 - js-multiformats had a breaking change release that resolves some CommonJS + TypeScript issues 


@warpfork
- ipfs/go-cbor-format finally has a status text redirecting to newer alternatives: see https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-cbor/pull/77/files?short_path=b335630#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5
- design review discussion on LinkContext: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/154 -- is anyone interested in this or have feedback to add on that design?
- from others:
	- go-unixfsnode will be progressing further in providing unixfsv1 features as an ADL
		- there's an intent to advance it to at least support read of sharded directories, shortly.
			- (This is needed for it to successfully replace some other code that the ipld-prime-in-ipfs project is trying to migrate.)
		- reminder that there's a roadmap visible here: https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/pull/3

@mvdan
- dag-pb codec spec update (code update basically ready)
- perf improvements for dag-pb codec, for go-merkledag
- a couple of thoughts on ipld-prime perf improvements
