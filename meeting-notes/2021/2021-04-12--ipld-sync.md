## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - js-multiformts in js-ipfs:
   - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/pull/116
   - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/3556
   - We'll see if we can get examples work (they use different bundlers). Then there will be a decision whether to polish those PRs or if we abandon them
   - I'm now full-time off IPLD, so I'll help in very limited capacity
     - My maintenance responsibilities of JavaScript bases libraries are handed over to @achingbrain and @rvagg
 - Others:
   - [js-multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats), [js-dag-pb](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-pb), [js-dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-cbor/) all have open PRs to make them work with CommonJS + TypeScript types

@warpfork 
- will be putting active energy into docs and specs site renovation, and repo unification!
	- found a static site generator that actually {checks all the boxes} and {is much faster} and {has much trimmer output} than other things we had worked with previously; very happy about this.
	- this will result in me chasing people about closing or merging PRs in the specs and other repos!

@willscott 
- dag-json can't represent bytes?
- wrote a first pass at [carbon](https://github.com/willscott/carbon) as an extension to carbs
- the split between node and selector [representation](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/4dc68933b5ce3abb427577c69ccfbb27844b49de/traversal/selector/selector.go#L29) is [ugly](https://github.com/ipfs/go-fetcher/pull/16/commits/69e4d9ba3745c36f090b435ea259daf8f1a9e8e6#diff-06b12fe63593401394c96bf8d6eadb04cfda029cfaac4634612187a5d52fd356R34).

@yourname
 - _add what you've been working on_


## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

 -  Should we change from weekly to every two weeks?
  - Yes! @vmx will take care updating the README and the calendar invite
