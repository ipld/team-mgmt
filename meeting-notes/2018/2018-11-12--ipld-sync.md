### Questions

### Other notes

IPLD meeting is time to primarily unblock and discuss issues.

Notes will be kept in ipld/team-mgnt repo (or equivalent of).

GraphSync current state:

* 3 proposals

There's an idea to implement a base API and run simulations on top of it to prove usefulness in particular replication scenarios.

One issue with all the specs - how to send a _rejection_ when you don't have a block?

`getMany` is an optimisation: we can move whether we need `getMany` or not to a separate conversation at a later date.

Merging is outside of the scope of bitswap and GraphSync. If you want to do that, you pull things in, merge, re-broadcast the change.

Use case - give me everything new until you see this CID - root is constantly changing 

**Action point:** to help complete the spec: **list the use cases**

Question - Why is bitswap not good enough?

**Action point:** break of selector spec into it's own spec.

- Multistream 2.0 https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/95
- libp2p daemon currently has a simple, message based protocol with support for streams of objects
  - an example of a [function that returns a stream](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon/blob/master/dht.go#L114)
  - the [proto def](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-daemon/blob/master/pb/p2pd.proto)
  - note that a stream starts with a `Response` but all subsequent values on the stream are not wrapped in that outer layer
