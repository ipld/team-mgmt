## Notes

@stebalien
 Please comment on mentioned issue if you're interested. 
 Some thoughts on moving CIDs to multiformats from IPLD, but likely doesn't make a huge difference.

@warpfork IPLD interfaces not used very actively in Go projects yet.  Want project suited to be beta user / driver for go-ipld-prime development.  Maybe start go-unixfsv2 repo.


@daviddias
 - Why is unixfsv2 dragging? Why are so many people assigned?
 - IPLD when it started had a lot of interest in suggestions from contributors. We should go back and take a look at some of the previous ideas and issues and see how relevant they are, so can loop these contributors and ideas back in.

@aschmahmann Working on synchronizing versioned graphs. There is also some discussion on an API for versioned graphs https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities/issues/50.

@mikeal 1) Use CBOR, 2) look at and post specs to replication repo https://github.com/ipld/replication/

@mikeal There is no canonical format for IPLD nodes. Converting between JSON-LD and the CBOR equivalents is managed by the developers. --@mikeal did I get this right?

@daviddias There is a lot of conversation about the IPLD DAG HTTP/RPC API https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/issues/81#issuecomment-277271941. DAG CBOR has less defined structure then the older Protbuf implementation, so there are some things to still work out.

@volker When we talk about the HTTP API we assume it's a JSON API. Does it have to be JSON or can it be something else?
 - @stebalien we can't currently just send raw data because we can't send metadata in headers (not supported by our HTTP/RPC API). JSON makes this easier though.
 
@warpfork it would be nice to have more people dedicated to IPLD, especially since there is insufficient people in Go land to review @warpfork's code.
 - @daviddias utilizing older Git issues and publishing specs will help get people involved in reviewing code.


### Two-week Update

@vmx
 - JS IPLD API specs

@warpfork
  - Done:
    - go-ipld-prime has mutable arrays now
  - Questions:
    - do we have some upcoming projects (alpha or betas) that would be good fits to drive go-ipld-prime beta?  preferably non-core so we can burn in slowly.
  - Next:
    - moar go-ipld.  tests mutable maps, test deeper structures; need toTokenStream...
    - todo:self: comment on unixfsv2 about union mechanism
    - maybe time to start a go-unixfsv2 repo as that beta user of go-ipld-prime?

@stebalien
  - Next:
    - Push on CIDs as peer IDs (https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/111)
