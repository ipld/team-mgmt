### Two-week Update


@warpfork
  - Done:
    - Progress on implementing a draft of IPLD schemas...
      - keeping to well-understood basics (sum types, product types, some specific recursive types).
      - Writing a "validate" method to use these.
      - Still lots to do, but shaping up nicely.
      - You can see some of a hypothetical DSL here: https://gist.github.com/warpfork/6df17e791936d1f9b0d5e5483678c8bf  (n.b. I'm not building a parser any time soon!  but maybe this can give a good gist of what I'm thinking.)
      - note that these are *structural* style schemas (contrasted with *nominative* style types).
    - I'm implementing this schema stuff as another Node interface!
      - so, you can wrap a 'cbor.Node' with a 'typed.Node' and it delegates the storage, while adding rules and behaviors.
      - this might be a relevant pattern to consider on the js side too...?
  - Next:
    - At the Reproducible Builds summit most of this week, talking to package manager folk.
