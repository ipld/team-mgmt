### Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Understanding Serde in order to write a deserializer for tagged values (that's the next TODO item at https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/issues/157)
 - The [DagPB Spec](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/0cc83a7c66bf66f12b5b18e6f440731963ed3345/block-layer/codecs/dag-pb.md) was merged!
 - Learnt a lot about error handling in Rust
 - Meeting notes to GitHub PR helper: https://ipld.github.io/team-mgmt/docs/index.html

@warpfork
- ethereum devcon -- interesting conversations
- some wee docs advancements: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/203
- substantial hunk of codegen landed: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/32
    - includes unmarshalling into codegen structs!
    - (much of this was earlier, but now is landed on master.)
- have been iterating (repeatedly) on discovering desired shape of native typed value builders.
    - extremely tricky and intersectional problem.  good ergonomics and good performance (in both speed and compact-memory) nontrivial.
    - probably have a good idea now -- will implement later this week.
- some discussions around advanced layout systems -- hoping someone will exploration-report that.

@mikeal

- finished re-factoring ipld-schema-gen, back to writing unixfsv2 now
- committed to a plan to implement a base level MFS library on top of our js-unixfsv2 work
- need to figure out what timeline we think we can land the new HAMT in

@rvagg
 - out for most of last week
 - some go-ipld-schema catch-up work
 - Waiting on @warpforks input on https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/196

### random notes

- buzhash implemented and benchmarked: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-chunker/pull/16
    - and in go-ipfs already, plus moar benchmark: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6701
    - we should follow up on this for unixfsv2 -- should consider it for a default.
- Question (@mikeal): @rvagg: How far along is the current js-HAMT implementation that we could use for UnixFSv2:
    - @rvagg: pretty ready
