### Weekly Update

@vmx
 - 100% Filecoin now, but still doing a bit of Rust IPLD related stuff
 - Will move forward with Rust IPLD without Serde
     - Serde would mostly just be another level of indirection

@rvagg
 - Browser testing & tiny bit of CBOR parsing. Trying to get my browser testing tooling in a publishable state in the next couple of days.

@warpfork
- got to run the design idea of "racker" nodebuilders past hannah -- we didn't find obvious improvements nor showstoppers, so, that design will now move forward into implementation.
- got some feedback in regards to docs at a larger ipfs gathering
	- the latest stuff on the specs subdomain is awesome
	- we need to fill in more of the basics and the data model docs next
	- got some asks for migration guidelines from the older go libraries
		- in particular, an ask for notes about "DagService" and what to do now in place of that.
	- a couple issues in our hopper from the larger community pointing out that the ipld main site is also a pretty terrible onramp at the moment
	- generally: sounds like we should keep expanding on the latest excellent docs work, and also see about updating the main domain to something useful.

@mikeal
- lab week!
- working on solidifying toolchain for IPLD Schemas in JS
- porting some open data to IPLD as a use case
- UnixFSv2 integration will be delayed
