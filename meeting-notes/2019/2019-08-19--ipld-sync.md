### Weekly Update

@vmx
 - CIDs in CBOR will officially get tag 42! https://github.com/core-wg/yang-cbor/issues/13#issuecomment-521702377
   - Draft for such a spec: https://gist.github.com/vmx/2c06d4a9228b3d815bccd467c15af72c
 - Upgrade ipfsd-ctl to async/await version in js-ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2368 


@warpfork
 - having a long dark teatime of the soul regarding map ordering.
   - I initially got into this while trying to make well-optimized decoding logics (esp. for structs with codegen), but turns out that's not the only place that has concerns with ordering.
   - the gist of the problem is:
     - it's very difficult (if not impossible) to avoid the ordering question in the Data Model.  We need iterators.
     - if a codec has an ordering opinion (and some do), and the Data Model has a different ordering opinion, costs emerge.
     - supporting transformations on data while preserving order seems to also count as the above -- costs emerge.
     - if we want to specify ordering on the Data Model, well, it's not clear we can: consider hamts, where there's a natural order, but it's by hash of the key, and if we want an iterator which does anything else, we're hurting (the performance will be trash).
   - in other words, there's a set of constraints for which a single reconciliation isn't obvious and might not even be possible.
     - and because the choice is actually spread across codec(s!) and Data Model, finding a correct place to home this abstraction is rough.
   - cool.  (read: ow)
   - an exploration document on this will be upcoming.

@rvagg
 - went further down the Zcash block decoding rabbit hole than I intended, for ipld-zcash https://github.com/rvagg/js-zcash-block
 - some IPLD HAMT work

@mikeal
 - issue follow-up from last week's spec issue cleanup
 - need to work on roadmap & OKRs based on meetings
 - metrics work (GitHub Actions as a cron job) https://github.com/ipfs/metrics


### Notes

#### CBOR

- there's a new iteration on the CBOR spec; it has key sort order recommendation?
  - https://github.com/cbor-wg/CBORbis/
  - Diff between current CBOR spec and WIP spec: https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7049.txt&url2=https://cbor-wg.github.io/CBORbis/draft-ietf-cbor-7049bis.txt

#### Out

 - @vmx will be out 2019-08-25/09-03 (Sun-Tue) at the [FOSS4G conference](https://2019.foss4g.org/) in Bucharest, Romania.
