## Notes

### Two-week Update

@vmx
 - IPLD Formtas API cleanup implementation: https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format/pull/51

@rvagg
 - Collections survey and initial "utility collections" framing in specs repo: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/110
 - Schemas:
   - Initial schema parser (PEG.js grammar pasted in Slack, will get onto GitHub soon)
   - Working on minimum-viable-thing that can prove its utility, aiming to connect it back to my hamt implementation to take the place of reading and writing blocks
   - Current thinking is that it will read some kind of reference to the collections logic so it knows how to defer to that logic for traversal and there will also be a return, probably with continuation-passing back to the spec reader to process new blocks.

@warpfork
  - first schema PRs heading into specs
  - some specs PRs attempting to get more clear on Data Model "kinds"

@aschmahmann
 - Been looking at some of the libp2p/notes, including https://github.com/libp2p/notes/issues/11
   - Looks like @mikeal has been thinking along a similar line with https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/57
 - Looking at ACL-type behavior for DAG synchronization, but will likely put it off for now and assume that DAGs cannot have permissions revoked without forking
   - This problem is pretty important, but need more time to actually work on it
 - Hope to try another stab at converting the DAG synchronization protocol at https://github.com/aschmahmann/ipshare to use go-ipld-prime in the next 1-2 weeks

### This meeting

#### Meetings

 - @mikeal: last week we had meetings for go-ipld-prime and schemas and they worked really well, I'd like to do that more regularly as a show-and-tell. Off-weeks when this meeting isn't running, we should schedule meetings focusing on specific pieces of work and vary attendees depending on target audience.

#### IPFS Camp

 - @momack2: coming up in June, want to create materials that live beyond the event. 4 main courses about IPFS, one is how IPFS deals with files (UnixFsV1), would like someone from IPLD-land to help create the course.
 - @mikeal will be primary interface, Volker to help
 
#### Webseeds / ipld.earth

 - @aschmahmann: @mikeal can you explain the idea behind it a bit more?
 - @mikeal: we often have content that is heavily used but seeding it can be a problem, the webseeds model is used by the bittorrent folks for reducing bandwidth concerns but not impacting storage.
 - _Further discussion about CIDs vs returning multiaddrs for further DHT traversal .. discussion to move back to GitHub, possibly_ https://github.com/libp2p/notes/issues/11
 
#### Questions

 - @vmx: Do I need to do anything special with the dynamic loading of the IPLD Formats in the Browser
   - @mikeal: No. webpack does all the magic.
