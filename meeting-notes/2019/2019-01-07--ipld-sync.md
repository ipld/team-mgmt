### Two-week Update


@warpfork
  - Done:
    - had some good conversations at CCC, got new ideas about open-vs-closed unions/etc; have notes, need to boil down into takeaways.
    - developer / code layout documentation for go-ipld-prime.  Describes Node iface, why so many impls, etc.
    - documentation looks forward to separation of schema ast vs reified (latter can have cycles, former needs cycle-breaking names).
  - Next:
    - Boil open-vs-closed into a decision tree... um, schema, and document that.
    - Moar go-ipld-prime implementation.  Maybe fleshing out some of the ipldcbor.Node impl?  A lot of things need love.
    
Note for the Reader: go-ipld-prime is the complete revamp on the IPLD internal implementation of go-ipfs. It will replace the current implementatation, including the MerkleDag protobuf references.

@vmx
  - Done:
    - Implementing the new js-ipld in js-ipfs
      - https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format/pull/50
      - https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld/pull/185
  - Blocked:
    - nope
  - Next:
    - further work on the new js-ipld

@stebalien
  - Done:
    - review and discussion
    - IPLD constraints and requirements: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/85
  - Next:
    - more of the same
    - Address CR on IPLD constraints document.
    - Maybe an IPLD definitions document?
    - GraphSync Protocol Designers Sync (Read all the proposals \o/)

@aschmahmann
  - Done:
    - Switched append-only DAG synchronization to use IPLD from protobufs
  - Questions:
    - To do the DAG synchronization there needs to be a shared root. Not sure how to deal with synchronization based on just a name/IPNS key. Have some possible solutions but open to suggestions
    - Any thoughts on how to deal with multiple alternatives for backlinks? e.g. if I squash multiple Git commits into a single state checkpoint I should be able to advertise both the commit and the checkpoint
    - Happy to be a go-ipld-prime guinea pig
    - TODO: Look at https://github.com/google/trillian#verifiable-log-backed-map
