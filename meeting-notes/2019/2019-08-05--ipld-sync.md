### Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Found out that [CBOR Tag 42 is already taken](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml). We are currently [in contact](https://github.com/core-wg/yang-cbor/issues/13) with the people that have registered that tag.
 - Released new version of [js-ipld-dag-pb](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb/releases/tag/v0.18.0) and [js-ipld](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld/releases/tag/v0.25.0)
 - PRs for UnixFS that update to those versions. @achingbrain merged and released them
 - Next: Integrating all those new releases into js-ipfs. That's harder than it sounds as ipfs-repo needs to be updated to a new version which is using async/await instead of callbacks.

@warpfork
  - Did a bunch of performance work on refmt / go-ipld-cbor.  Got some drastic improvements.
    - Most of these improvements transitively apply to go-ipld-prime instantly as well.
  - Zillions of PRs to specs documents about "foundational principles".

@rvagg
  - Go programming, partially implemented HashMap in Go on top of go-ipld-prime
  - Portability of complex and large test fixture data for testing across languages
  - Minor storage backend experiments - .zip storage, filtering/selector to pull out only active parts of the graph to remove blocks created during mutation

@mikeal
  - OKR call (weeks ago)
  - UnixFS "Reboot"
  - IPLD PAC meeting
  - bundle sync (time permitting)

### Specs repo PR closing session

Agreed to turn next week's meeting into a PR closing session for the github.com/ipld/specs repo as there's a lot of historical PRs taht are in limbo and shouldn't be hard to deal with.
