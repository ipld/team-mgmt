### Weekly Update

@mikeal
 - js ipld schema api generator (sort of codegen)
 - unixfsv2 ipld schema
 - lots of 'project update' things

@warpfork
 - substantial progress on codegen!
   - representation gen for struct-as-map: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/commit/8569cb3e403277f6e1fe18feca6902fd41a41e20
   - increasingly solidified abstractions from this should make the rest go easier.
 - had some more fun with performance research
   - proximal application is "can 'type Path []PathSegment' be good and fast if 'PathSegment' is an interface?" as well as some deciding some error type guts.
   - tl;dr "no"
   - deeper inspection/disassembly of earlier benchmarks that seemed to indicate clever solutions uncovered the interesting bits getting compiled out.  sigh; lessons learned.
   - can YOU spot the diff?  https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZhPIjLkByJwIRmGLWSvxfJSs
- still todo is landing that map ordering exploration report.
  - it just kept growing.  my rough notes are >400 lines; needs cleanup at this point.
- did some prose work on "north star" purpose statments for design dirs: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/179
 
@rvagg
 - https://github.com/rvagg/js-ipld-hashmap IPLD frontend to IAMap (HashMap algorithm), mutable version with simpler storage interface
 - https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/180 allow int, byte and string keys in the HashMap, for discussion

### Notes

- discussion about IPLD data structure bulk update costs and strategies for mitigating
- discussion of DHT problems when sharing large numbers of CIDs. "provider strategies" is the term to search on for finding more notes on dht publish and lookup keys. Jim: https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers/issues/84
