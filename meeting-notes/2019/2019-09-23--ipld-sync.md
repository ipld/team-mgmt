### Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Working on making tags work in https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor
 - Will be moving to part-time on Filecoin
 - This week: Adding examples to the IPLD selectors spec (based on the work @warpfork already did)

@rvagg
 - more work Schemas
   - `advanced` is in specs and JS parser and Mikeal is using it already for his UnixFSv2 work
   - pending in specs: "copy" type, int enums, byteprefix union representation - once all done in some form we should be able to support Filecoin's schemas

@warpfork
 - conference time.  highlights:
   - Connected with some OCI spec maintainers at All Systems Go -- looking forward to following up with them more to get some input on unixfsv2, especially.
   - Contact with some of the Varlink developers
   - Meetup hosted by Statebox folks -- some more looking at Typedefs (tactically different but philosophically (very) similar to IPLD Schemas); also discovered CQL (https://www.categoricaldata.net/) which might be worth a look for anyone working on functional transformations / morphisms / call-it-what-you-will on top of IPLD data.
