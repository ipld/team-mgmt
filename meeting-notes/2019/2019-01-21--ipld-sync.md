  - _add your agenda item_


## Notes

New []OKRs for Q1](https://github.com/ipld/roadmap/pull/4):

 - IPLD Selectors for Go an JS

Selectors work:

  - @vmx starts on the JS, then collaborates with @warpfork on the Go side:
   - Try to describe the AST with the new schema stuff


(@daviddias) Make IPLD less coupled to IPFS:

 - Agreement. That's the plan. Storage is already less coupled. Doing networking would be cool, but it is way harder.


(@mikeal) How to add items to the Project WG Agenda

 - Use this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZ8tyWKnuXKTMbYaZO_8FVUKJ1kxA4imgPaTBhXXbAc/edit#heading=h.8p6cr7n4eqoh 

### Two-week Update

@WARPFORK
  - (10min) Schema sharing time!
    - https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/1
    - Everything you were promised: all kinds of types: product kinds, sum kinds, and well-known recursive kinds.
    - Self-describing schema draft: JSON and DSL forms.
      - Example schema
      - Actual schema schema!
    - go-ipld-prime//typed.Node implements these checks -- same ipld.Node interface.
    - Code gen future plans.
  - Traverse() + Transform() methods in go-ipld-prime -- functional/"optics" methods.  So far for single nodes :) selectors should jive nice soon too.

@vmx
  - Still working on getting the [new js-ipld API](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld/pull/185) work with js-ipfs
