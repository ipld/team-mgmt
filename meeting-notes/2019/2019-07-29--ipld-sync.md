### Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Done:
   - Released a new version of js-ipld-dag-pb: https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb/releases/tag/v0.18.0
     - Lots of breaking changes, hopefully this is a stable version now for a long time
   - Updated UnixfsV1 to use this new dag-pb version (not pushed yet)
     - Ran into `npm link` issues. Documented them in an upcoming blog post which then refers to the only working solution: https://github.com/hugomrdias/connect-deps/
  - Exchange format between WASM<->Host language is likely to be CBOR to start with. In the future we could add other IPLD Codecs
  - Using a WASM-based CBOR encoder/decoder for JS doesn't make much sense. Creating a JS object is expensive and that's a step you always need to take. For a PoC I'll probably return a stringified JSON string and use `JSON.parse()` on the JS side.
 - Next:
   - rust-ipld-dag-cbor: Find out how to represent the parsed IPLD Data Model in Rust/with serde (Rust (de)serialization library)

@rvagg
 - https://github.com/rvagg/bit-sequence for turning arbitrary sequences of bits into an integer, for HAMT indexing
   - Did a JS version to put into iamap https://github.com/rvagg/iamap
   - Did a Go version using the same fixture data https://github.com/rvagg/bit-sequence/go
 - Ongoing npm package data experimentation, playing with putting it into a HashMap with different parameters and considering performance. Will be trying to come up with slightly more formal output from that to write up somewhere to help guide future work.
 - Learning some Go, building a version of iamap / HashMap / HAMT with it against go-ipld-prime.
