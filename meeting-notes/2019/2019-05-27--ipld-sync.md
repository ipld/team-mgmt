## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

@vmx described the work on js-ipld-dag-pb. The plan is to strip down the API as much as possible as the only real user is UnixFS. In should serve their needs and doesn't need to be as general purpose as other IPLD Formats.


### Two-week Update

@vmx
 - IPLD Format changes are merge, released an used in js-ipfs 0.36
 - Went over multiformats to see if they can be streamlined/cleaned up
