### Two-week Update

@vmx
 - IPLD Selectors:
  - Spec: https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/7ba014c1b6868514eb461db3c3126136b9250bdc/selectors/selectors.md
  - JS implementation: https://github.com/vmx/js-ipld-selectors/
    - Especially see the tests, you can add your own easily without doing any JavaScript: https://github.com/vmx/js-ipld-selectors/tree/master/test/fixtures
 - Tooling around selectors:
   - Specify a DAG for testing within a single file: https://github.com/vmx/dagbuilder/
   - Create Graphviz diagrams to view your DAG: https://github.com/vmx/ipld-graphviz
 - Moved to Travis CI on all repos I'm the lead maintainer of

@hannahhoward
 - Graphsync:
   - Most blockers removed for a while
   - Architecture agreed upon
   - Will be using mock go-ipld-prime and mock blockstore to build initial implementation
   - Pushing forward this week, mostly sole focus is go-graphsync
