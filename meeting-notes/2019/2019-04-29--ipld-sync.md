@mikeal
  - ipld.earth works, still getting subdomain working properly w/ cloudfront
  - virtual meetup next week!
  - summit in 2 weeks!
  - 

@warpfork:
  - bunch o selectors work!
    - links:
      - spec updates: https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/116 
      - go interface link: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/cd9283ddd86af15b9bc4a1f5b71f00fbfc2f8b94/traversal/selector/selector.go#L10-L14 
      - go parser code example: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/cd9283ddd86af15b9bc4a1f5b71f00fbfc2f8b94/traversal/selector/selectFields.go#L35 
      - Tests! https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/cd9283ddd86af15b9bc4a1f5b71f00fbfc2f8b94/traversal/traverse_test.go 
    - not sure this is the final round -- have some unfinished trains of thought about selectors being a composition of matchers and explorers.
      - and would love some other design chats with folks about this if anyone has time
  - had the "what's next for filecoin<3go-ipld-prime" chat with whyrusleeping
    - tl;dr probably bind.Node
    - as yet unclear how to prioritize this overall
  - Better to have schemas sooner rather than later
    - Might be worth trading off doing the DSL later for writing Go schema validators now

@rvagg:
 - Worked on schemas (continuing this going forward)
   - Trying to get to the useful sooner rather than later, we can perfect more later
 - Talked with @warpfork about Union representations
    - Union structs are fundamentally weirder than most of the other things we have to deal with
    
Webseeds https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/57:
 - @aschmahmann Do we know what our performance requirements are on the DHT for provider records
 - @mikeal Not in the general case, but for some use cases we have a better idea. If we need access to all versions of NPM packages individually it might be rough, for smaller package managers might not be so bad.
 - @aschmahmann While it doesn't help with the DHT issues would the proposal at https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/57#issuecomment-486867032 be helpful for providers that don't necessarily want to run a full set of IPFS cluster nodes yet?
 - @mikeal seems like it could be useful, not sure how much of a pain upgrade is
 - @stebalien might be a big pain, it depends on how we plan the upgrade path.
 - @stebalien also not clear if we should really be (ab)using multiaddrs to refer to content instead of just refering to the machine + protocol.
 - To be continued...
