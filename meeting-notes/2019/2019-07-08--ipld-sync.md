## Notes

### Two-week Update

@mikeal
 - Barcelona discussions have created some changes:
   - unixfsv2 needs to use advanced layouts / composites, so it's higher priority
   - @vmx starting on webassembly + rust
   - Hannah coming over to help with Go

@warpfork
 - Had some engagement on selectors
 - Filecoin guys are starting to use IPLD Schemas so that will put some more pressure to get them working
  
@rvagg
 - Got a Vector spec up last week
 - Have some minor changes to make to HashMap
 - Discussed the process for landing

### Selectors

 - @jonnycrunch joined and began a discussion about IPLD selectors and their state. Addressing with CIDs and matrix parameters in a URI to include the selector.
 - @mikeal selectors is mainly being driven by graphsync
 - some more minor discussion

### JSON Schemas

 - @jonnycrunch showed some JSON Schema work using IPLD and suggested that registering an "ipld" scheme would make for some interesting use with schema identifiers
 - discussed the problem of an "ipld" scheme not being properly resolvable - they don't tell you _how_ to resolve unlike most (all?) other schemes
 - further discussion
