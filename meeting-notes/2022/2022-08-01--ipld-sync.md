## Weekly Update

@rvagg
 - go-car security release
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4h-8wgm-8xfg
     - allocation-related problems found by Joroppo with fuzzing, so we now have limits for some things when parsing CARs
     - still some remaining problems with CARv2 indexes
     - now includes a stronger recommendation to _not_ read untrusted CARv2 indexes, but regenerate them (ideally don't use CARv2 for transports if you don't need it)
 - CAR "messaging" experiment
     - From a request - "want to be able to embed additional metadata about a CAR within the CAR"
     - We could use data offsets of CARv2 to make space to embed additional data prior to the CARv1 payload, so the metadata is separate and we don't break spec
     - https://github.com/ipld/js-car/pull/89
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/322
 - go-ipld-prime@0.18.0
     - Bindnode: [Custom Go type converters](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/414)
     - Bindnode: [Type registry](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/437)
     - Bindnode: [Full `uint64` support](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/414/commits/87211682cb963ef1c98fa63909f67a8b02d1108c)

- @adin
    - Proposal to move management/governance of CID spec to IPFS spec process (i.e. IPIP) https://github.com/multiformats/cid/pull/51
    - Some folks have reached out to some of us in the IPFS community interested in how WASM might be useable. They have some tooling for WASM APIs they're going to be describing at https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/polywrap-overview/14861
    - If folks have questions about how wasm-ipld works https://github.com/aschmahmann/wasm-ipld/pull/5
        - Happy to also have a more synchronous walkthrough with interested folks
    - Talk about block limits: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WLCMCxzQDaITi93x-wIfChp2O0yMy-24VgkyJ0hhrgY/

- @RangerMauve
    - IPLD gateway/URL spec: progressing, should we use Matrix URIs for parameters?
        - https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html
        - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/293
    - Interested in WASM ABI for ipld-wasm

- @mohsin
    - Waiting for final review of [amend](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/445). Need to discuss packaging.
    - [Draft PR](https://github.com/smrz2001/go-ipld-prime/pull/4) for map/list interfaces that:
        - Establishes a more user-friendly interface for recursive types since the current way to use maps or lists (builders, assemblers, etc.) is inconvenient and hard to use.
        - Allows modification transparently, with all the optimizations `amend` brings.
    - Async iterators?
