## Weekly Update

@RangerMauve
- Progressed on new "What is IPLD image" for the website
- Set up reviewers team. (Thanks Piotr) How shall we use it?
    - PR template?
    - Docs?
- IPLD URL Scheme
    - Got some reviews: https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/195
    - Might be doing a rough implementation in Agregore to see how it feels

@rvagg
- Big JS Bitcoin Codec upgrade, it lives again: https://github.com/rvagg/js-bitcoin-block/pull/2 & https://github.com/ipld/js-bitcoin/pull/3 (weekend distraction project)
- go-codec-dagpb security fix went out a few weeks ago, advisory now published @ https://github.com/ipld/go-codec-dagpb/security/advisories/GHSA-g3vv-g2j5-45f2
- Minor fix in go-ipld-prime to get it toward the "unified-ci" process, add macOS to Actions: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/400
- Walked through a basic tutorial with Lindsay for IPLD using go-ipfs to inspect and modify a UnixFS DAG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLgxTYoF-K4, original notes: https://pl-strflt.notion.site/Explaining-DAGs-Roots-and-UnixFS-to-newbies-ff89ed883f1b4c5da8af13cd8ad07de9 - this will likely be redone in a more polished form by Lindsay for Launchpad.

@adin
- Discussion around codecs, ADLs, signatures and more fun around UCAN (https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/264) also in Matrix/Discord
- Did a CGO wrapper of the C library for detecting SHA-1 collisions. go-multihash interfaces might want to change from the standard one which doesn't support errors https://github.com/multiformats/go-multihash/issues/57#issuecomment-1109034658
- All code on GH for initial WASM + IPLD prototype (Rust code in https://github.com/aschmahmann/wasm-ipld/pull/1)
  - Hopefully by next time some draft specs to get started on!
- Something floating around the back of my mind recently. Let's say we build a protocol for transferring large blocks, people have been using CAR as an type of data transport. Do we need to make a new type of CAR that supports incrementally verified large blocks (i.e. no CAR files that are just a single 1GB SHA-2 block)

@vmx
- IPLD representation for [Lurk](https://github.com/lurk-lang/) (a SNARKy VM): https://gist.github.com/johnchandlerburnham/d9b1b88d49b1e98af607754c0034f1c7
