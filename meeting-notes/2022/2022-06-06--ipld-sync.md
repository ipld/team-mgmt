## Notes

### IPLD URIs next steps

- maybe work into ipfs gateway - readable and possibly part of the writable gateway spec
- a go-ipld-prime package in traversal to handle this, like patch & update
- talk to the .storage team (Mikeal, Alan, Ollie) who are doing IPLD heavy work with http endpoints
