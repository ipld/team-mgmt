## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - Rust Serde based DAG-CBOR codec is a thing: https://github.com/ipld/serde_ipld_dagcbor/
   - Based on [cbor4ii](https://github.com/quininer/cbor4ii). Huge thanks to the author (quininer) who has been *very* responsive and helped a lot with issues I was facing.

@aschmahmann
 - Working on wasm + IPLD things
     - Reworking APIs to include ADLs for more than just large bytes
     - Sharing more structures across the API
     - Includes writing an implementation of the BitTorrent Directory ADL
         - Still fighting with Rust since I'm new at it üòÅ
     - Next up is
         - Finish BitTorrent Directory ADL
         - Rework Go bindings
         - A demo traversing BitTorrent files

@rvagg
 - About to get the final piece of the unified-ci puzzle together for go-ipld-prime: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/409 (previously got Windows, macOS working, staticcheck and other vet fixes in)
 - Progress toward a new Go Bitcoin codec (hack week project)
 - Lots of minor fixes & discussions

@mohsin
- Pushed [prototype](https://github.com/smrz2001/go-ipld-prime/pull/1) for IPLD update
- Added [notes](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/320#issuecomment-1120443060) for new approach
- To summarize:
    - Cost of JSON patch operations is amortized across multiple operations.
    - New `AmenderNode` provides a "lens" to `Encode`, which just sees a `Node` with accumulated updates, and only copies on write.

@RangerMauve
 - Going to be finishing up IPLD Patch
 - Stuff got merged (what-is-ipld.svg, @ipld/reviewers team)
 - About to merge exploration report for IPLD URLs https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/195
