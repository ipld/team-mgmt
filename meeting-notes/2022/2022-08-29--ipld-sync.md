@rvagg
 - Closed out https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/87, along with https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/233
 - Yuge update @ https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-schema including new name `@ipld/schema`
     - Schema parser
     - Schema printer (opposite of parser)
     - Schema validator / converters - use a schema to make a function pair that will validate and convert objects according to that schema and then back again
     - Examples in the README
 - Helping @gozala get https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/pull/197 closed - `Link` interface to use in place of concrete `CID` class

@Jorropo
 - Thinking about decompilable selectors in go-ipld-prime (convert selector.Selector interface back to datamodel.Node) for RAPIDE client
     - https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/RAPIDE-3c4fb9e159ae471bb426bb81855cee16

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

@dvdrw:
 - How to deal with arbitrary codecs?
   - @rvagg: In JS 2 use cases:
       - 1. IPFS: you get arbitrary blocks and try to decode it. You want to have many different codecs
       - 2. Your own custom system: Likely only one codec (or at least way less many)
           - This is what we currently mostly cater with js-multiformats
   - Similar issue ran into by @RangerMauve recently: https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/issues/173
     - tl;dr use `codec.decoder.or(otherCodec.decoder).or....` to build up a union
 - How to do different pathing for different codecs (e.g. DAG-PB vs. DAG-CBOR)?
   - @rvagg: In IPLD DAG-PB is treated as legacy. Pathing should always be over the data model
   - @aschmahmann: For multi block things like HAMT, use ADLs
   - @RangerMauve: IPLD Schemas can make pathing nicer
     - @rvagg: https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-schema#typed-converters--validators
