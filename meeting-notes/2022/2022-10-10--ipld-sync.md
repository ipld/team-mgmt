## Weekly Updates

IPFS Camp 2022 is a thing: https://2022.ipfs.camp/ 2022-10-28/30


@biglep: I have a conflict today, so can't make it :( 
 - It will make sense to levarage Lisbon/LabWeek to discuss IPLD and next steps for the project.  If there are certain IPLD topics you want to cover, please share.  I'm stretched too thin right now so welcome anyone else taking the lead on unconf time, IPFS Camp session, etc.  
 - It would be ideal to motivate an IPLD roadmap before or during this event.  Feel free to take a stab on this if interested.  Juan said he's willing to meet and engage to make this happen before or during the time there. 


@RangerMauve
- Working on document outlining my vision for what IPLD could be in the future
- Progress on IPLD URL spec and use in Agregore (can traverse links!)
- Gonna be doing a talk at Lisbon on IPLD

@rvagg 
 - go-merkledag@0.8 - remove many possibilities for panic()s, it's now much more difficult to put a ProtoNode into an unencodeable state
 - js-multiformats v10 to be released today: https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/pull/199
     - lots of work by @RangerMauve, @Gozala, @achingbrain
     - `Link` interface for CIDs
     - ESM-only, no compile step
 - UX review of ipld.io with Julia: https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/240 - there's also a Slack channel to discuss, need to make that public so others can join
     - Not a fast process, we don't have anyone signed up to _implement_ changes yet but we're walking through possible changes to the site

@warpfork
 - has graduated into an IPLD user :upside_down_face: 
   - you may see some chats from me at IPFS Camp in Lisbon at end of Oct about IPLD datastructures applied to versioned data, package descriptions, etc.
 - did you know?  @dustmop still hacks away on https://github.com/ipld/go-datalark/
   - it is growing easy-to-use "mutation sidecars"
     - these accept mutation syntaxes in starlark and freeze into a COW copy on demand -- best of both worlds :D
