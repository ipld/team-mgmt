  - Ask for last minute agenda items
- This meeting
  - _add your agenda item_


## Weekly Update

@rvagg
 - CommP calculation bug in Boost - creating a CAR twice yielding different bytes: https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost/issues/673
     - very minor go-merkledag dag-pb / go-codec-dagpb implementation difference for decoded blocks under _certain_ circumstances
     - isn't triggered by primary (new or old) JS or Go codecs because they all encode as per spec (always have)
     - triggered by third-party dag-pb implementations that don't quite follow Links sorting rules
     - dag-pb spec changes: https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/233 (WIP - doesn't quite reflect go-merkledag status properly)
     - Boost fix: https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost/pull/675
 - go-car/v2 selective CAR skip option - attempting to get @willscott's PR mergeable and working for thread-safe multiple CAR creators on arbitrary skip bytes with a shared state (i.e. minimal blockstore reads)
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/291
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/327
     - ... currenly considering whether (and how) to proceed
 - Updated [js-ipld-schema](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-schema) for latest IPLD Schema changes + ESM + types (including a really nice schema-schema.ts)
 - Updated [js-ipld-schema-validator](https://github.com/rvagg/js-ipld-schema-validator) for latest IPLD Schema changes (validate objects based on an IPLD Schema)
 - Working toward an `@ipld/schema` package that combines the above but turns the validator into a transformer - `schema.toType(repr)` & `schema.fromType(typed)` to both validate and convert to and from representation and typed forms.
 - Iterating toward possible CIDv2 https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/305 - CIDv1 + metadata / type / context / tag
 - Amend discussions https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/445

@RangerMauve
- Getting IPLD gateway into js-ipfs-fetch / making high level JS library for encoding/decoding
- Catching up on WASM discussions
- Starting to convert js-multiformats to new ESM build tools, will roll out to other repos
- Prolly trees grant, looking into moving to Rust to better integrate with the FVM

@adin
- UnixFS implementation things
  - The [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) folks are implementing one in Rust
  - Found some bugs in go-unixfsnode https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/issues/33
  - TLDR: This seems like a good opportunity to advocate for more specs work + test fixtures since the iroh folks are starting down this path anyway
- [WAC Spec](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/226/files)
    - Got feedback from folks on using a single float type that's a Double-precision (64-bit) IEEE 754
        - The IEEE spec is behind a paywall üò≠
    - Spec needs a bit of cleaning up, but now basically matches the IPLD Data Model
        - If time ask a question... is anyone currently using non-utf8 bytes as data model strings other than me in the Bencode codec?
- Review of CIDv2 things to give some feedback
- Writing some blog posts -

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

### Selectors vs ADL + Pathing

- Discussed the use-cases for selectors and whether ADLs and pathing solve the majority of use-cases. Most common operations are: root+path -> give me the DAG, or just a block. There are other operations that are useful for selectors like range queries over ADL data (UnixFS).
- Potential for simpler APIs to do the kinds of operations selectors are doing
- Using a hard requirement that _all selectors must work_ increases complexity wherever we bring that, but maybe we don't need it in many of those places

#### non-utf8 strings

- Filecoin uses cbor string keys
- Adin's bencode work uses non-string keys

### CIDv2
