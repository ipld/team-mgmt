  - _add your agenda item_


## Weekly Update

@vmx
 - CIDv2 discussions: https://hackmd.io/@vmx/HkoYAr64o
   - Current most promising proposal is the "application context" one
     - Would still need a new multihash code for parametrized hash functions
 - News from the ecosystem:
   - rust-ipfs (https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs) is no longer maintained. Alternatives:
     - [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/) (most promising endevour atm), for more info see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_dw8SLSQlQ
     - [ipfs-embed](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed/) (doesn't strive for full compatibility), for more info see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCt3if9H64I
   - IPLD docs: get restructured and move to a new platform (Hugo based) 

@warpfork
 - this'll just be a few pieces of "IPLD in the Wild" :)
 - unveiled "Warpforge" at the IPFS Camp 2022 event last week!
     - there's a talk recording here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wcOjT580iaI
         - at around 15 minutes in (where the background slidesl color flips to white), there's a section which focuses on "Catalogs"
             - .... which is how we solve package naming and metadata distribution problems in a decentralizable way.
                 - spoiler: it's IPLD.  lots and lots of hash-linked data.
     - you can also see our IPLD Schema here: https://github.com/warpfork/warpforge/blob/master/wfapi/wfapi.ipldsch
 - an interesting field experience report on trying to use datalark and IPLD Schemas to generate data...
     - The context: We're looking at generating instruction files for Warpforge ("formula" and "plot" data, specifically).
     - The discovery: We often want to generate _partial_ fragments of data... and invoking types too early is actually making this _harder_ and less fun.
         - We'd often end up making lots of intermediate types with half as many fields, or with optional fields, etc.  Which... ehh, no.
         - Or: we make a bunch of _untyped_ data (e.g. handle those fragments as dicts and untype lists), and apply type strictures to it _later_.
     - The outcome: still unknown!  We're gonna try that "apply types later" approach in our next round of r&d, and we'll probably have more experiences to report later.


@mohsin
 - [Reworked](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/445) approach for IPLD amend to implement logic in `basicnode` instead of in traversal.


@willscott 
- [car debug / compile](https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/341)

@RangerMauve
 - Lots of IPLD database talks at Lisbon
 - Prolly Trees spec nearing completion
 - IPLD Team Roadmapping in progress
 - Starting up a WG
