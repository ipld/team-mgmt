## Weekly Update

@biglep
> (I am out this week.  I would have liked to share this verbally.)
> 
> 📢 We’re going to be at reduced capacity from a project maintenance and feature development regard for the next few months due to some changes with the core maintainers of go-ipld-prime.
> 
> @warpfork has started a planned leave to rest and rejuvenate.  His presence will be spotty and unexpected over the next 3 months before he returns.  We’re excited for this unique season for him, hope he has a wonderful time off, and look forward to his return. 👍
> 
> @mvdan had a too-good-to-pass-up opportunity outside of PL EngRes that he’s decided to take.  I don’t think he can share the details yet, but I expect he will when he can.  Dan will always be welcome in the IPLD community, and we’re definitely going to miss his active and helpful presence 😢.  Best of luck Dan on the endeavors ahead!  🥂
> 
> PL EngRes has a weekly triage for IPLD to ensure we’re aware (and acting where appropriate) on issues an PRs that come in.  The notes for this are here: https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/IPLD-Triage-Notes-e19f3f592dc9470ebce62b50691a3db5
> 
> IPLD hiring continues to be a key area for PL EngRes.  If you or someone you know would be interested in software engineer, engineering management, TPM, or community management roles, feel free to @mention or DM me.  The IPLD software engineer position is posted (https://boards.greenhouse.io/protocollabs/jobs/4409537004 ) and other roles will follow suit.
