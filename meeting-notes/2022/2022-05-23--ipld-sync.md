## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

 WeiliYang: Why Prolly trees?
   - To have a sorted data structure, where you can e.g. do range queries on

 WeiliYang: What do range queries in the Web3 world look like? SQL? Something else?
   - @willscott: Selectors might be an option: with a "startsAt" and "endsAt" addition: https://ipld.io/specs/selectors/
