## Notes

@rangermauve
 - Will identity CID limits also apply to CIDv2?
     - @rvagg: we need some limits, start with some arbitrary one and go from there - make it "conversational", i.e. if the limit we've set is too low for some usecase, let's talk about it and maybe raise it

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
