## Weekly Update

@warpfork
 - Had a lot of conversations with Petar last week about type systems and he is very interested in making a more open-ended sort of union feature.  I've made some writeup on this here: https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/177
 - We got a gnarly edge case in the golang selectors implementation fixed recently...
   - See the new fixtures addressing it here: https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/172/files
 - 99% of a new doc about ADL Signalling, almost ready to land (review welcome): https://github.com/ipld/ipld/pull/155
 - (reporting cool things that others have done lately)
   - Peergos has made some new work on block level encryption they'd love to share: read more about it here: https://peergos.org/posts/bats

@willscott 
  - Thinking about the right way to support resumption traversals as a building block for allowing resumption of car creation.

@vmx
 - Rust IPLD:
   - rust-multihash and rust-cid releases planned for this week
   - libipld release planned for this week

@rvagg
 - Lots of playing with bindnode for graphsync, helping find bugs and identify rough areas, @mvdan doing a champion job of making it production-ready
 - go-car: v2 blockstore can now create just a CARv1 https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/288, CLI `car create` now has a `--version` flag so it can make a CARv1.
 - Big 'ol fix of go-unixfsnode to produce "correct" output (missing Tsize in a few places) and HAMT wasn't working for sharded directories; also came up with some boundary condition tests to match exact go-unixfs bytes
 - go-ipld-prime dag-cbor length checking on encode to avoid invalid bytes https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/333
 - go-ipld-prime dag-cbor EncodedLength() proposal: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/346
 - go-ipld-prime equivalent of https://github.com/rvagg/js-ipld-garbage
 - Wrote [initial PLN Launchpad IPLD curriculum](https://protocol-labs.gitbook.io/launchpad-curriculum/launchpad-learning-resources/ipld)

@jonnycrunch
- w3C DID and VC, credential chaining with IPLD
- Identity Hubs and Encrypted Data Lockers

@biglep
 - Proposal and process for moving PL's engineering chat happening from inside PL Slack into public spaces like Discord.

@Jorropo
 - Making an "efficient" chunker + estuary pinner: [github.com/Jorropo/linux2ipfs](https://github.com/Jorropo/linux2ipfs)

## Notes

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->

From @biglep:
 - For @jonnycrunch: do you have any feedback on what you need from IPLD to have confidence to build more on it?


Discussion about linux2ipfs details:
  - Using copy file range and not using normal write API
  - Flag to trim a file from the front `FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE` 
  - and much more
Lesson from above:
  - This seems to observe that we still haven't nailed the IO abstraction layering right :'(  It was too hard for someone to do this performance optimizing work and drill it through all our library layers.
