## Weekly Update

@rvagg
 - go-ipld-prime@0.17.0: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0170
 - helped get base256emoji over the line @ https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/rfcs/Base256Emoji.md + a JS implementation in js-multiformats (to be merged)

@rangermauve
 - Working with Rod on the ESM transition
 - Got new docs merged in
 - Gonna do a PR for a devgrant to standardize "prolly trees" for IPLD search indexes
 - Talking to Lidel about `/ipld/` in the gateway, might be a path forward to integrate `PATCH` for updating existing IPLD objects

@adin
- Draft go-ipfs (kubo) PR showing WASM IPLD Codecs and ADLs leveraged as plugins https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/9016
  - Go code separated out
  - BitTorrent Directory v1 WASM ADL
  - WIP PR https://github.com/aschmahmann/wasm-ipld/pull/2
  - Work on cleaning up the PR + specs in progress
- IPFS Thing (https://ipfs-thing-2022.on.fleek.co/) is happening. It's an event for maintainers or core contributors of an IPFS implementation, ranging from production usage to working demo. See the website for more details.
    - I'm leading a track tentatively called Data agony and IPFS. Probably will have a bunch of IPLD discussions. If you have a talk you want to lead or hear about open a PR to the GH repo and tag me üòÄ
    - Some example things people have expressed interest in disucssing:
        - Making UnixFS less privileged compared to other ADLs in things like IPFS Gateways
        - Blocks/ADLs/Checksums... what's up

@willscott 
- https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/gateway-prime
- indexer entries are working to support HAMT as well as lists, expect some improvements on the HAMT ADL as a result (thanks to @masih)
- Reframe extensions to support caching, providing (less IPLD specific related)
- there's some on-going work supporting more efficient streaming CAR indices

@mohsin
 - Added benchmarking tests and posted [test results](https://github.com/smrz2001/go-ipld-prime/pull/1#issuecomment-1152992683) to [IPLD Amend PR](https://github.com/smrz2001/go-ipld-prime/pull/1).
 - Need to discuss remaining task items and next steps.

## Notes

### Discussed Patch + Ammend

 - @moshin's Ammend impl @ https://github.com/smrz2001/go-ipld-prime/pull/1 - "bottom up"
 - Current IPLD Patch impl - "top down"
 - How to ensure the API can be both, i.e. efficient for basic data model for encoding (COW-like in Ammend) vs applying a Patch to an ADL

### Upcoming work: layered TypedPrototype

Discussion in https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/issues/443

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
