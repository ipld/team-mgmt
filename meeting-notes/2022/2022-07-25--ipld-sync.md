## Weekly Update

@rvagg (carried over from 2022-07-18 meeting that didn't happen)
 - go-car security release
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4h-8wgm-8xfg
     - allocation-related problems found by Joroppo with fuzzing, so we now have limits for some things when parsing CARs
     - still some remaining problems with CARv2 indexes
     - now includes a stronger recommendation to _not_ read untrusted CARv2 indexes, but regenerate them (ideally don't use CARv2 for transports if you don't need it)
 - CAR "messaging" experiment
     - From a request - "want to be able to embed additional metadata about a CAR within the CAR"
     - We could use data offsets of CARv2 to make space to embed additional data prior to the CARv1 payload, so the metadata is separate and we don't break spec
     - https://github.com/ipld/js-car/pull/89
     - https://github.com/ipld/go-car/pull/322
