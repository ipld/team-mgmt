# IPLD Team Planning, Management & Coordination

IPLD is a set of standards and implementations for creating decentralized data-structures that are universally addressable and linkable. These structures will allow us to do for data what URLs and links did for HTML web pages.

This repo tracks project management issues like our calls or quarterly [OKRs](okr) planning. For general information about IPLD, refer to the [IPLD website](https://ipld.io.io/) or [the main repo](https://github.com/ipld/ipld).

# Weekly call

We run a an IPLD call every week **Monday 21:00–22:00 UTC**. You also find it on the [IPFS community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC)

Link to join the call: https://protocol.zoom.us/j/935904840 (note: it’s recorded, [live streamed](https://www.youtube.com/c/IPFSbot/live) and public)

Anyone is welcome to join! If it’s fine to come if you just want to learn about IPLD.

# The Team

This is a list of what people are working on **right now** and also work items that are "on deck" or have been bumped
down each person's priority list.

You'll notice that nobody has more than one high priority item at a time. That's not because they don't work on other things,
but every person on the team is a maintainer of numerous ongoing efforts and as a result only has time for one high priority mid to
long term project effort at a time.

* @mikeal
  * **P0**: Managing the team (this never changes or gets bumped)
* @rvagg
