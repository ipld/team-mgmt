# IPLD Team Planning, Management & Coordination

IPLD is a set of standards and implementations for creating decentralized persistent data-structures that are universally addressable and linkable.

This repo tracks project management issues like our calls.
For general information about IPLD,

or [the main ipld/ipld repo](https://github.com/ipld/ipld)
(which contains the documentation, specifications, website source, and main issue tracker.)

# Former meetings

The IPLD Team held regular meetings for several years that were live streamed on YouTube. An archive of all recorded calls can be found in the [IPLD playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtRfR6VhISbSiPJ87rsN3Pb9).

We also archived [the meeting notes of the previous calls](https://github.com/ipld/team-mgmt/tree/master/meeting-notes) for anyone interested.
