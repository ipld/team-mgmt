# IPLD Team Planning, Management & Coordination

IPLD is a set of standards and implementations for creating decentralized data-structures that are universally addressable and linkable. These structures will allow us to do for data what URLs and links did for HTML web pages.

This repo tracks project management issues like our calls or quarterly [OKRs](okr) planning. For general information about IPLD, refer to the [IPLD website](https://ipld.io.io/) or [the main repo](https://github.com/ipld/ipld).
